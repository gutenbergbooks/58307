<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> history of times and events, of men and their characters,
must ever be replete with interest and instruction.
Chronicles of the great and wise, the noble and the learned,
are often presented to the world; and the military hero and
chieftain finds everywhere his biographer. We read of campaigns
that his mind has traced out, of battles which his plans
have won; and we forget, in our admiration of his skill and
power, those by whom the heroic deeds were done, the victory
gained. Generals, says one author, &#8220;often calculate upon
men as though they were blocks of wood, or movable machines.&#8221;
Yet every one of these nameless soldiers has feelings
as acutely alive to suffering and to honor as those who
look upon them thus.</p>

<p>It is well sometimes to turn away from the glare and tinsel
of rank, from the glitter of arms and the pageantry of war, to
follow the common soldier in his partings and wanderings, to
cast the glance of pity upon his sufferings, and allow the
heart to be moved with compassion while regarding the temptations
which must ever beset his path. It is only thus that
a true knowledge of the evils and miseries of war can be
obtained; and only when this knowledge is spread far and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_IV" id="Page_IV">[IV]</a></span>
wide, that we may hope to see the banner of peace unfurled,
and the olive-branch waving in quiet, where now the sword
spreads its desolation, and the vulture feasts on the unburied
dead.</p>

<p>Thoughts like these may, perhaps, lend interest to the unpretending
narrative of one who now presents himself and the
scenes of his times before an indulgent public, with none of the
advantages of rank, or birth, or fame, to recommend him to
its notice. Simply one of the rank and file, he was an actor
and participator in the scenes he has endeavored faithfully to
represent.</p>

<p>It is his ardent wish, by this little volume, to awaken more
interest in this class of his fellow-beings, so often forgotten
in the lustre of that halo which rarely fails to surround the
victor&#8217;s name.</p>

<p>The work, such as it is, he cheerfully commends to
the <i>public</i>, looking with unshaken trust to its kindness
and sympathy for the success and encouragement which he
hopes it may be his lot to meet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">People</span> advanced somewhat in life, and surrounded
by a family of children, often find great pleasure in
retracing scenes of their own childhood,&mdash;in living
over, again and again, the hours which have been to
them so productive of happiness or misery; and the
events of those bygone days present to their minds
scenes of far deeper and more thrilling interest than
the present can ever do. The thrice-told tale is as
new, and as glowing with interest, as though its occurrences
were but of yesterday. This is true in the
case of most whose lives have been diversified by the
changes of varied condition and prospects. But how
much more true is this of the old soldier,&mdash;one who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
in early life, became inured to the hardships of war
and the severe duties of camp life. Scenes in the
camp, and on the bloody field of martial combat,
where death, in its most terrific forms, is met by
many,&mdash;the horrors of the siege, and the consequences
to the vanquished,&mdash;the sufferings, the writhings
and groans, of the distressed and the dying,&mdash;too
deeply impress the mind to be ever erased; and, in
our times of peace, should serve to enhance the value
of the blessings we enjoy. It is, perhaps, with something
like these feelings, that the author of the following
sketch presents his narrative to the public.
He can claim no titled ancestry, nor lordly birth, to
throw around him a fictitious glory. This tale draws
its interest from the wild scenes of war, and the
wilder passions of men&#8217;s souls, which it has been his
fortune to encounter. It is his hope both to instruct
and amuse the young, that they may better prize the
blessings of peace; and learn that war, with all its
glory, is to be dreaded, not sought for,&mdash;that it is
productive of far more evil than good, even to the
successful party, and that it should ever be, to all
nations, only a last resort from the most flagrant
oppression.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PREVALENCE OF THE MILITARY SPIRIT.</div>

<div class="sidenote">BROTHER KILLED IN BATTLE.</div>


<p>I was born in Dendolk, in the county of Lowth,
Ireland, in June, 1793. I was the youngest of
eleven children, six of whom were sons, and five
daughters. My father&#8217;s name was Charles O&#8217;Neil,
and my mother&#8217;s maiden name was Alice McGee.
My father was a carpenter by trade, and he supported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
his large family by daily toil. He was an
industrious and active laborer, and in other times
would gladly have seen his family settle around him,
pursuing the peaceful avocations of husbandry, or
engaged in some of the useful mechanic arts. But it
was our fortune&mdash;or misfortune, I should say&mdash;to
live when all Europe resounded to the din of arms,
and the glory of martial life, amid the confusion and
carnage of battle. Napoleon, the mightiest of heroes
and conquerors, was then rapidly ascending to the
zenith of his glory; and all the crowned heads of
Europe, terrified by his growing power, and anxious
to save themselves and their thrones, began to prepare
themselves for resistance. Recruits were sought
for in every village and hamlet. The honors of the
soldier&#8217;s life, and the glory of the military profession,
were everywhere, and by all classes of people, the
topics of conversation. Fathers and mothers were
careful to instil into the minds of their children the
glory and honor of a military life, and the fair young
damsels of our own dear island&mdash;for Ireland has
charming and beautiful girls&mdash;were scarcely willing
to regard any young man as honorable or brave,
who did not enlist, and aim to deserve well of his
country. He is a soldier, he has fought in such a
battle, he belongs to his majesty&#8217;s regiment, &amp;c.,
were a sure passport to society and respectability.
All other occupations were considered tame and spiritless,
fit only for the aged, infirm, and for cowards.
My father caught the spirit of the times, and although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
too old to engage in such an enterprise himself, gave
his ready permission to Arthur, my oldest brother,
who early sought to distinguish himself on the field
of battle. My mother&#8217;s consent was not so readily
given, but even she did by no means object to his
new enterprise; and when he presented himself
before his parents, in his new uniform, for their parting
blessing, she felt proud that her son was possessed
of such a noble, courageous soul. She cheerfully
gave him her hand, saying, &#8220;Go, my son;
cover yourself with glory in the service of your country,
and when you are old, you will be honored,
respected, and provided for.&#8221; But, alas! how little
did my mother think that the first news she would
hear from her first-born son, after this blessing, would
fill her own heart with grief unutterable. He enlisted
into the navy, and was placed upon a seventy-four
gun-ship, named the &#8220;Terrible;&#8221; and terrible,
indeed, it proved to him, for he was killed by a cannon-ball,
a few months only after enlisting, in an
engagement which took place in 1807, near the coast
of Holland, between his majesty&#8217;s fleet and the French
naval force. His death was a severe affliction to my
parents, and completely damped my father&#8217;s desire
for military honor for his children. It was, therefore,
with deep regret that they saw in my brother
James&#8217; mind a growing dislike to the quiet duties
and occupations of home, and an earnest longing for
those warlike scenes which had been so fatal to Arthur.
This desire soon grew so strong that entreaties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and persuasions were alike useless from my dear
and aged parents; and in less than two years from
Arthur&#8217;s death, he enlisted in the royal army of
George IV., in the 96th regiment of foot. It was
a sorrowful day in our little home, when the news
came that his regiment was ordered abroad, into the
foreign service. My father gave him much good
advice, with many directions for the attainment of
that honor he hoped to see him enjoy, at some distant
day. But my poor mother could only weep, and
express her deep regret that Jimmie would not be
contented to live at home, at the same time reiterating
her confident prediction that she should see
his face no more. Since the melancholy death of
Arthur, the glory and honor of military life all gave
place to the carnage, the slaughter, and the dreadful
sufferings of the battle-field, where no kind hand
could minister the slightest consolation, and where
agony unmitigated might be the fate&mdash;and to her
mind undoubtedly would be&mdash;of her son. She wept
aloud, and would not be comforted. But the die was
cast; Jimmie was resolved, at all hazards, to be a soldier.
He thought not of danger, and did not fear
death. He only thought of the excitement of martial
strife, the joy and honor awaiting the victor, and
the subsequent reward. Alas! for him the bright
future never dawned. My mother&#8217;s fears were but
too well founded; for he, too, fell dead upon the field
of battle, while fighting bravely for his country, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
his first engagement, in the bloody battle of Talavera.</p>

<p>It was my father&#8217;s wish that I should become a
carpenter; and he, early in life, put me an apprentice
to his own trade. But the quiet habits, constant
labor,&mdash;destitute of an exciting or romantic incident,&mdash;of
a mechanic&#8217;s life, ill suited the tastes I had
already formed. There resided near us an old soldier,
who found great pleasure in relating the adventures
of his past life; and I was never weary of listening
to them. My imagination was excited, and
the romantic scenes he related to me, with the thrilling
incidents of a soldier&#8217;s life, made a deep and
permanent impression upon my mind. Alas for
me, that I ever fell in company with this old soldier!
My peace was destroyed; I was uneasy, and determined
not to remain in my employment, as a carpenter&#8217;s
apprentice. Each interview with him
strengthened my desire for a participation in those
scenes which, I was sure, would be so delightful and
interesting.</p>

<p>Mingled with a desire to see foreign countries,
and be a sharer of those actions to whose thrilling
narration I had so often listened with so much interest,
came an ardent thirst for revenge on those whom
I regarded as the murderers of my brothers. About
this time, one of my cousins, to whom I was warmly
attached, resolved to enlist in a regiment that was
then being formed at Belfast. He was very anxious
that I should accompany him. It did not require<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
much persuasion to induce me to determine so to do.
But I remembered how difficult it had been for my
brother James to gain my parents&#8217; consent, and being
anxious to avoid a scene which must be so painful to
all, I resolved to leave without their knowledge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">REFLECTIONS ON LEAVING HOME.</div>

<div class="sidenote">JOURNEY TO BELFAST.</div>

<p>This was a most wicked resolution, and deeply do
I regret such an unkind and unwise act. It was not
without many misgivings and fears that I left the
home of my childhood. O, that I never had stifled
that voice which so clearly bade me not to go under
such circumstances! There were many things to call
up these misgivings, and to hold me back from such
a cruel purpose. The uniform kindness of my parents,
the severe trials to which they had already been subjected,&mdash;for,
beside the loss of my brothers, they
had buried four of their children, in early childhood,&mdash;their
known wishes that I should pursue my
father&#8217;s calling, the affection I still felt for home and
my dear parents,&mdash;all these made me hesitate, as I
stood at our little gate, with my earthly all in the
small bundle I held in my hand. There, on the one
hand, were my dear parents and brothers and sisters,
all quietly asleep, wholly unconscious that I had formed
such a wicked purpose, and by stealth packed my few
clothes, and whatever else I could call my own, in
my little bundle; there was the home of my childhood,
the hallowed scene of my early sports and
joys, under the smiles and watchfulness of the kindest
of parents; there were the early associates of
my boyish days, and all necessary to render me happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and quiet;&mdash;and, on the other, were the glories of
the military profession, and the unreal pleasures I
had anticipated in foreign countries,&mdash;scenes and
events pictured in my imagination from the stories
of that old soldier. The realities of home, and all
that was dear on earth, opposed to the more heated
imaginations of scenes in other countries, and upon
the field of carnage,&mdash;I almost resolved to go back,
and become what my parents wished. I hesitated,
at that solemn and still hour of the night, for some
time, before I could break away. Had I only gone
back, and done what I knew I ought to have done,
it would have been right; and I caution all my young
readers never to stifle such convictions, or break
away from such restraints. But the thought of my
cousin, who was waiting for me, and the glowing
scenes which my imagination had painted in the
countries beyond the sea, to which I hoped soon to
go, drowned the earnest pleadings of the good spirit,
whose still small voice was heard in my soul. I,
with sudden violence, sundered these unpleasant
reflections, and madly resolved, come what would,
to go ahead. I rushed, with the utmost rapidity,
from my home, and drowned every conviction and
thought that would come up in my soul, of all that
I had left behind. I soon found my cousin, and we
pursued our way to Belfast, with the utmost rapidity.
How little did I then think that so many years
would elapse before I should again see that well-known
spot, and those dear friends who, in spite of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
my wildness and disobedience, had loved me through
all, and were unceasingly seeking my best good! But
I was now to enter another sphere of life, and be
subjected to far other influences than those to which
I had been accustomed from early childhood. I was
at this time only seventeen years of age,&mdash;1810. My
comrade, like myself, was quite young. Our ideas
of the happiness of a soldier&#8217;s life were much the
same; and we amused each other, on our lonely way,
by relating all the adventures either of us had ever
heard, of what was then to be our future profession.
When morning came,&mdash;that morning in which there
was to be so much grief in our quiet homes, and when
the tears of my dear mother, and her groanings, were
to be again heard, for an absent son, who had stolen
away,&mdash;we feared to be recognized, by some one
who might be passing, if we continued our journey.
So we stopped in an old, deserted hut, and making
our simple meal of the bread we had brought with
us, we lay down and slept. About four o&#8217;clock in
the afternoon, not seeing any one near, we pursued
our way, and travelled all night. The next morning
found us far from home, among scenes and people
entirely strange, and greatly fatigued by our night&#8217;s
march. We found a teamster, who was going to
Belfast, and, by much persuasion and entreaty, succeeded
in persuading him to carry us to that city.
Right glad were we to rest our weary legs, and
amuse ourselves by gazing at the new and strange
objects which met our eyes as we passed along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
road. We reached Belfast about sunset. Neither
of us had ever before seen so large a place as this;
and we thought, as we rode through some of its principal
streets, that we never should be weary of gazing
upon its churches and public buildings, which appeared
to us so grand and beautiful.</p>

<p>This city is one of the principal seaports of Ireland.
It lies about ninety miles north of Dublin, on
the banks of the river Lagan. With a population
of forty thousand, and all the advantages which it
possesses for trade, it may well be imagined that we
found in its busy streets and crowded thoroughfares
enough to rally again all the excitement and glowing
visions which our fatigue was beginning, in some
degree, to dim. But when our driver stopped at a
small inn, in one of the back streets of the city, a
good supper and bed seemed too inviting to be
resisted, and we were soon asleep. At early dawn,
however, we were awakened by the roll of the drum,
and were soon in the street, gazing, with wondering
eyes, at the many strange sights we saw. Near our
hotel a canal came in, which connects the little lake
of Lough Neagh with the Bay of Belfast. The
canal-boats attracted our attention, and my cousin
proposed visiting them; but, far over the tops of the
houses, I could see the tall masts of the vessels
which lay moored in the harbor, and I could not
restrain my curiosity longer. So we were soon on
our way to the port. The harbor is an excellent one.
It is constantly filled with shipping, as vessels drawing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
thirteen feet of water can easily anchor here.
We had scarcely reached the wharf, when I was
surprised to hear a familiar voice calling my name.
Turning hastily, I discovered an old playmate, who
had left Dendalk about three years since, for the sea.
He belonged to one of the large vessels now in port.
Nothing could have been more opportune for us, as
he was acquainted with the place, and showed us the
ship where he was, which we should not otherwise
have had an opportunity of visiting.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A RECRUITING OFFICER.</div>

<p>To him we confided our object in leaving home,
and he promised to aid us in finding the officer.
Soon after leaving the wharf, we passed a large building,
which, my friend informed us, was a manufactory
for Irish linen, which is one of the staple exports
of the place. I afterwards learned that no less than
eight hundred looms found continual employment in
the production of this valuable commodity. But
much as I should have enjoyed a visit to this place, a
scene now presented itself which had, in my eyes,
far greater attractions. Near the centre of a small
open place stood a covered cart, embellished with
flaming handbills, giving a description of the success
of the British troops on the peninsula. On its top
stood a neatly-dressed soldier, who was haranguing,
with much earnestness, the motley group that surrounded
him, and calling loudly for recruits to engage
in such glorious service. Judging from the description
we heard, our most sanguine expectations had
fallen far short of the reality; and of course this was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
an opportunity not to be lost. We eagerly pushed
our way through the crowd, which we had some difficulty
in doing; but the eagle eye of the officer soon
rested on us, and, perceiving our eagerness, he called
out, &#8220;Make way, make way there, my lads! that&#8217;s
right, that&#8217;s right,&mdash;fine soldiers you&#8217;ll be, my
hearties, I warrant!&#8221; Of course, all eyes were
directed to us; and if any idea of retreating had
occurred, the loud hurrah for the new soldiers, which
ran around the crowd, would at once have decided
the question. But no such idea came to disturb our
peace, and our names were handed in. Being asked
how long we would serve, each of us answered,
without a moment&#8217;s hesitation, &#8220;For life.&#8221; &#8220;For
life, then, are you soldiers of his majesty,&#8221; the officer
replied.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DISCONTENTED WITH THE SERVICE.</div>

<p>Each of us then received from him eighteen guineas,
and were sent to the barracks, as members of
the 8th regiment of foot. Much elated with what
we considered our good fortune, we proceeded at once
to make a selection of our kit, as it is called. This
consisted of two shirts, two pairs of stockings, a
plate, knife and fork, and a few other small articles,
the cost of which does not often exceed a guinea.
A suit of regimentals was then provided for us, by
the officer of our mess, and we soon found ourselves
quite at home in our new situation. But we had not
been here long, when we began to find the old adage
applicable in our case, &#8220;All is not gold that glitters.&#8221;
The drills to which we were subjected were very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
tiresome to those as unaccustomed to any kind of
restraint as we were. In addition to this, as many
of our troops had deserted, we were so closely
watched that we lost all the enjoyment that I had
anticipated in viewing the curiosities of the city. It
was hardly to be supposed that, unwilling as I had
been to submit to the quiet restraints of home, I
should find a pleasure in the rigid discipline of the
parade-ground; and before one week had passed away,
I found myself pondering whether I could not, in some
way, escape from my regiment. Not that I intended
to give up the military profession entirely, for I
still thought that in some other place I should find
the happiness I sought. Every night, after we had
retired to our quarters, I listened to the many tales
my comrades were ever ready to tell, of those who,
weary of their lot as soldiers, had deserted,&mdash;of
their hair-breadth escapes, and the cruel punishment
to which they were subjected, when discovered.
The very romance connected with the undertaking,
and the thrilling interest that existed
in listening to these adventures, strengthened in my
mind my desire to share in their experience. It also
occurred to me that should I still wish to continue
in the service, I might go to another part of Ireland,
where I was unknown, and again receive the bounty-money
offered to all enlisting. Yet all these motives
would have been insufficient, had not an incident
occurred which aroused all the independence and
opposition of my nature. I was unjustly accused of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
a breach of discipline, and, in spite of my protestations
of innocence, was punished for it. This circumstance
was sufficient to overcome any fear that
might exist of the consequences; and the very next
day&mdash;only twelve days from the time I had entered
the service, with such glowing anticipations&mdash;an
opportunity occurred, which I determined not to lose.
Close to the parade-ground was a small shop where
liquor was sold, and which was much patronized by
the soldiers. Into this shop I saw an old clothes
man enter, and immediately followed him. Having
ordered a pint of porter for him, I asked him if
he would be willing to exchange his old and ragged
clothes for my new suit. He said he would, and
informed me that I might meet him under a bridge
near, where we might make the exchange. Observing
that no one was near, I went under the
bridge, and soon reäppeared, dressed in his old
clothes, and bearing his pack. Thus disguised, I
walked bravely onwards, even passing some of my
old comrades, who did not recognize me. The alarm
was soon given, and soldiers started in pursuit. They
soon came up to me, and even stopped to inquire if
I had seen any one pass.</p>

<p>It was with no small degree of pleasure I saw
them take another road from the one I designed to
pursue. As soon as they were out of sight, I
renewed my speed, feeling anxious to get as far as
possible from Belfast before another morning. At
length, wearied out, I solicited and obtained permission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
from a farmer to remain during the night. He
observed me, however, so closely, that my suspicions
were aroused, and I began to fear that he would
attempt to inform against me, in order to obtain the
reward offered to those who deliver up a deserter.
He questioned me quite closely, as to where I had
been, where I was going, and, finally, asked me
directly, if I had not been a soldier. I denied it at
first, but soon concluded that my best way would be
to appeal to the old man&#8217;s generosity. I did so, and
was not disappointed. He not only did not inform,
but kindly offered to assist me on my way. Before
daylight we arose, and I dressed myself in a suit of
clothes, with which he furnished me, and taking my
seat by his side, in his market wagon, was once
more on my way home. He talked to me long and
faithfully on our journey, nor did he leave me until
he saw me alight at my father&#8217;s door. Good old man!
I shall never forget his kindness. He has long since
gone to his reward; yet at this distant day my heart
throbs with the recollection of it, and I shall never
forget the old farmer of the Downs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RETURNS TO DENDALK.</div>

<p>My parents received their returning son with true
parental affection, and to them I gave what money
still remained from my enlistment bounty. When I
first returned home, they earnestly hoped I should
now be willing to remain there; and I might, perhaps,
have yielded to their entreaties, could I have
done so with safety. But soldiers were often passing
through Dendalk, and I was in great danger of being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
recognized. This induced my parents to consent
that I should leave home a second time, and try my
fortune again in the camp. There was no lack of
opportunity. A regiment was forming at Navan,
and to this place I directed my steps, and soon found
myself enrolled as a member of the 64th regiment
of foot, and again received eighteen guineas from the
service.</p>

<p>I had been here but three days, when we were
summoned out to witness the punishment of a deserter.
He was an athletic young man, who had
been pressed into the service. He had left at home
an old mother, a sick wife and one child, dependent
on his daily labor for support. Finding all attempts
to procure a discharge unsuccessful, he had deserted,
and been retaken, through the treachery of a pretended
friend, who, for the sake of a few pounds,
could betray the distressed son and husband to so
cruel a punishment, and a still more cruel separation
from those so dearly loved. It would naturally
be supposed that the strong temptation which existed
for desertion might have mitigated the punishment;
but this was not the case. War recognizes none of
those affections which make the happiness of the
human heart. It seeks only to crush out their life,
or perhaps holds them up to ridicule, as things of no
moment. He was sentenced to receive three hundred
lashes. His sentence was executed, and we
saw him taken down, bleeding and mangled, and carried
to the hospital almost insensible. It was a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
time before he recovered sufficiently to perform duty.
He did not again attempt desertion. A few days
after, word was brought him that his wife and child
had died from want, and that his old mother was in
the parish workhouse. He was never seen to smile
again. The soldiers were all kind to him, but I
learned afterward, that he soon sickened, and died of
a broken heart. The sight of this punishment filled
me with dread, and threw quite a damper on my
exalted ideas of a military life.</p>

<p>Our commanding officer was very strict,&mdash;unnecessarily
so, as we thought,&mdash;in his rules, and rigorous
in the execution of punishments. He had been so
long in his situation, and seen so much of misery,
that his heart was completely hardened. Every
disobedience, even an accidental variation from his
orders, however trifling, was punished to the extent
of the law&mdash;often beyond it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ALARMING INTELLIGENCE.</div>

<p>If I had found the discipline and restraint of Belfast
unendurable, this was far worse. Nor was I at
all disposed to submit to it. I had deserted once,
without discovery. Why should I not do so again?
I was restless and uneasy, and came in for my full
share of punishment. I was thinking on this subject
one day, when my attention was suddenly arrested
by a conversation between two officers near me.
&#8220;How soon is the regiment expected from Belfast?&#8221;
said one. &#8220;In about three days,&#8221; replied the other.
&#8220;Do you know its number?&#8221; &#8220;The 8th regiment
of foot,&#8221; was the answer. It was the very one with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
which I had been connected! Of course, I should
be at once recognized, and not only lose the bounty-money
I had already received, but be punished as a
deserter. This dreaded prospect roused every energy
of my spirit, and I resolved to escape before
their arrival, at all hazards. Fortune seemed to
favor my undertaking. The next morning, which
was the 11th of June, only twelve days from my
second enlistment, I was sent out, with a number of
other soldiers, to bring back some horses which had
strayed from the camp, having broken from their
pickets. On my way, my attention was accidentally
attracted to a large tree, which grew near the
road. The tree was hollow, and its entrance was
completely screened from observation by a luxuriant
vine which twined itself around the trunk. As we
were searching for the horses, I succeeded in examining
it, without attracting observation, and found
that I could be concealed there for a short time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RESOLVES TO ENLIST A THIRD TIME.</div>

<p>Taking advantage of a moment when no one was
near, I placed myself in the tree, and, scarcely venturing
to breathe, awaited the search which I knew
would be made for me. Once or twice, a soldier
passed so near that I could hear the leaves rustle
against his coat. But their efforts were fruitless. I
was not discovered, and remained in my shelter until
the noise of their footsteps had died away. Then,
creeping out, I ran as fast as I could away from Navan,
avoiding as much as possible the highways, as I
knew that my dress would betray me. It was necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
that I should rid myself of it as soon as possible;
but there was great risk in doing it, as I
should, of course, betray myself to the one with whom
the bargain should be effected;&mdash;and, where all
were strangers, I dared not run so great a risk. I
did not wish to go home, as the danger to which I
was now exposed would be greater even than before,
and would be a source of keen distress to my mother.
So I directed my steps to my sister&#8217;s cottage, which
was much nearer than my father&#8217;s. Here I met with
a kind reception, and a secure hiding-place for some
time, in return for which I bestowed the whole of
my money on her. We had many conversations
as to my future course. She was very anxious that
I should give up my ideas of being a soldier, and go
quietly home. But to this I could not consent. I had,
it is true, ascertained that there were troubles in that
life, as well as in others; but I still thought that when
I had once entered upon active service I should find
my lot quite different. I had as yet seen no foreign
countries, nor could I bear the idea of settling down
to a steady employment. I wanted a life of ease,
excitement, and pleasure. I had heard far too much
of that intense excitement which pervades every
breast when the sound of the trumpet summons the
soldier to combat, and of the glory that follows the
successful warrior, to feel willing to give it all up.
Beside, my condition was now irksome in the
extreme. There was so much danger of being recognized,
that I could not feel myself safe anywhere.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
A description of my person and appearance had been
sent all over the country, with the offer of the usual
reward. I concluded that, should I enlist in another
part of the country, I should stand a much better
chance of not being recognized, as they would hardly
look for a deserter in the barracks. On the 3d of
July, therefore, I bade my sister a long farewell, and
started out in pursuit of a regiment. I walked all
day, and at night found myself at a small town so far
from my home that I thought I might venture to stop
at the inn, especially as there seemed to be no troops
near. I did so. I had eaten my supper, and was
about retiring, when I observed a list of deserters
pasted up in one of the rooms. Hastily running it
over, I saw my own description there too plainly to
be mistaken. Of course, I could not remain there for
the night; and, walking leisurely to the door, I was
just passing out, when my attention was attracted to
the conversation of two persons near. &#8220;I am sure it
must be he,&#8221; said one. &#8220;Did you read the description?&mdash;the
very same hair and eyes, I am sure,&#8221;
said the other. &#8220;We shall get the reward, no doubt.
As soon as he has gone to bed, we will send for the
officer. But come, let us go in, and take care that
he does not suspect us.&#8221; As I had recognized my
landlord&#8217;s voice, I considered that such treachery
was sufficient to justify a sudden leave; and, thinking
that he might take his pay for his supper from
his expected reward, I hastened away. Having
travelled an hour or two, I threw myself on a pile of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
straw, and rested till morning, determined that I
would trust myself in no one&#8217;s house until I was
again enlisted. It was, therefore, with pleasure that
I heard, soon after sunrise, the sound of martial
music in advance of me. Two hours after, I was
quietly ensconced in my quarters, in the Lowth Militia,
<i>en route</i> for Dublin, having the third time
received my money from government.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HIS REGIMENT IN DUBLIN.</div>

<p>Our progress towards the capital was very slow, as
we were constantly looking out and receiving additions
to our company from the peasantry of the places
through which we passed. The glowing descriptions
of our recruiting-sergeant, the thrilling sound of the
martial music, the very sight of so many well-dressed
soldiers, presented strong inducements to the ragged,
half-clad, and half-starved children of poor unfortunate
Ireland, to leave her shores for at least a season.
Then there was the hope of returning with the pension,
that would insure to them, in their old age, a
sustenance, of which they could be certain from no
other source. These inducements carried desolation
to many a home, but they filled our ranks; and, on
the 20th of July, we were in Dublin, with complete
numbers. Here I enjoyed more liberty than I had
done at either of the other stations, and had more
opportunity to see the place. The barracks are situated
in the west end of the city, near the beautiful
river which divides it into two equal parts. Not far
from them rises the noble hospital of Kilmainham,
destined for the reception of disabled and superannuated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
soldiers. The visits of these old soldiers was
a source of great pleasure to us, as we were never
weary of hearing them recount their tales of war and
of hard-fought fields; while, in listening to our anticipations,
and in seeing us go through the exercises
required, they almost seemed to renew their own
youth. Preparations were now rapidly being made
for our departure to England; and, as the time drew
near, my thoughts naturally reverted to my own dear
home, and I felt it would be a great privilege if I
could once more see my parents. I therefore wrote
to them, giving them a full account of my wanderings,
my place of destination, and begging them at
least to write to me before I left, and say that I was
forgiven for all the trouble and anxiety I had cost
them. The return mail brought me a letter from
them, assuring me of their love and forgiveness, and
promising to visit me before we left. I may as well
state here that I did not see my dear parents again.
They came to Dublin, as they had promised; but we
had left the day before, for Cork. They would have
followed me there, immediately, had they not been
informed, at the barracks, that I had left directly for
England. It was the policy of our officers to prevent
these meetings as often as possible, on account of
their effect upon the soldiers. And no one, in whose
heart lingered a particle of kindness, could look
unmoved on the spectacles of misery which it was
almost daily my lot to witness, when the time approached
for us to leave. Of the thousands collected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
there, waiting to be transferred to a foreign shore,
how few would ever return! and, of those few, how
many would come back, with ruined health and broken
hearts, only to find desolation and death where they
had hoped for love and sympathy! Many of these
had enlisted while under the influence of liquor, or
else had been brought in by the press-gang; and, in
thus leaving their families, they were deprived of
every means of subsistence, and must either soon
perish from want, or linger out a more protracted,
but scarcely less miserable existence, in the workhouse.
O! why must Ireland suffer so much from
her poverty, with her fertile soil and many productions?&mdash;that
deep poverty, which has forced so many
of her sons abroad to die, and which still continues
to force them abroad, to ask that assistance and aid
which it were worse than useless to expect at home!</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN AFFECTING SCENE.</div>

<p>Of these partings, to which I have referred, the
long course of years has scarcely dimmed the painful
impression they made upon my memory. One of
those oftenest recalled was that of a young man who
was bidding adieu to his aged parents. He was an
only son, and his most diligent care and labor scarcely
sufficed to supply them with the common necessaries
of life. Their lease had recently expired, and to
renew it again a sum of money was required which
was utterly beyond their simple means. Nothing
could save them from immediate ejectment unless
the lease was renewed, and this faithful son determined
to secure a home for his parents in their old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
age by gaining the bounty-money offered to volunteers.
To do this, however, he must submit to a
separation which he could not hope could be otherwise
than final; for who would care and labor for
them when he was gone? And those parents, accustomed
as they had been to his presence and kindness,
how could they live when the sunlight of their existence
had set? Never have I seen agony more
strongly depicted on the human countenance than it
appeared on his, as he turned away from their farewell
clasp. Poor fellow! he deserved a better fate
than afterwards befell him; for he died by the hands
of a guerilla, on the hills of Spain. What became
of his aged parents I never knew. We could only
hope that the angel of death would be merciful, and
come soon to their relief.</p>

<p>Turning away from this sad scene, which brought
tears into eyes all unused to weep, it was only to
meet another, which affected the heart almost as
deeply. A woman, pale and sickly-looking, worn to
premature old age by incessant toil and suffering,
and the mother of five little children, was bidding
farewell to her husband. He had enlisted while
drunk, and had spent or lost nearly all of his money
before recovering his senses. When he was able to
realize his situation, his feelings could scarcely be
controlled; for he was the sole dependence of his
helpless family. But there was now no help for him.
The money was gone, he had pledged himself, and he
must go, and leave his family to starve or live on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
bread of charity. But I will not dwell on this parting
scene. Suffice it to say, that, when our preparations
were complete, and our regiment ordered to
Cork, I left Dublin, with all its magnificence, without
a regret.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TREATMENT ON THE MARCH.</div>

<p>We marched to Cork,&mdash;a distance of one hundred
and sixty-two miles,&mdash;by slow and easy marches.
I believe the regulations of the service only require
ten miles&#8217; march in the course of the day; but we
almost always went further than that before halting.
From the time of leaving Dublin we began to receive
the usual pay of an English soldier, which is one
shilling per day, and two suits of clothes per year.
Of this sum the government retain one half, for furnishing
bread and beef. With the other sixpence
the soldier is required to furnish himself with whatever
else he may wish for; or, if we preferred it,
while marching in Ireland, the whole sum was paid
us, and then we purchased what we chose. By being
very abstemious, some of our men saved a few pence
daily, which was often transmitted to the suffering
ones at home. Whenever we halted for the night
the soldiers were billeted upon the inhabitants of
the place, each family being required to accommodate
one, two, or more soldiers with lodgings and a
supper. The number of the house and the name of
the street was given, on a ticket, to each soldier,
which he was required to present at the door, and
the family must either accommodate him, or furnish
him with money to procure lodgings elsewhere. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
was often very unpleasant for the inhabitants, and
the alternative, of course, was frequently adopted,
especially by the more wealthy classes. We were
not always treated with kindness by those who were
thus forced to receive us,&mdash;having frequently to put
up with the poorest accommodations that could be
furnished. But, as soldiers have never been noted for
their forbearance or mildness, such persons usually
found themselves worse off, in the end, than if they
had pursued a different course. As a general thing,
when treated with kindness, it was returned with
civility, especially while we were in our own country.
In the wars on the continent, in the frequent
passages of armies into the countries of their opponents,
the inhabitants often suffered severely from
this custom; and reprisals were frequently made,
when opportunity offered, which, if not justified by
the law of right, were most certainly by that of camps.
An incident, illustrating this, which occurred while I
was on the continent, and which afterwards appeared
in the newspapers of the day, may be given here, as
I shall not again have occasion to allude to this subject.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ANECDOTE.</div>

<p>A Prussian officer, on his arrival at Paris, particularly
requested to be billeted on the house of a
lady, in the Faubourg St. Germain. His request
was complied with, and, on his arriving at the lady&#8217;s
house, he was shown into a small but comfortable sitting-room,
with a handsome bed-chamber adjoining
it. With these rooms he appeared greatly dissatisfied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and desired that the lady should give up to him
her own apartment, on the first floor, which was large
and elegantly furnished. To this the lady made the
strongest objections; but the officer insisted, and she
was under the necessity of retiring to the second
floor. He afterwards sent a message to her, by one
of the servants, saying that he destined the second
floor for his aid-de-camp. This occasioned still
stronger remonstrances from the lady, but they were
totally unavailing and unattended to by the officer,
whose only answer was, &#8220;Obey my orders!&#8221; He
then called the cook, and informed him he must prepare
a handsome dinner for six persons, and desired
the lady&#8217;s butler to supply the table with the best
wines the cellar could afford. After dinner, he sent
for his hostess. She obeyed the summons. The
officer then said to her, &#8220;No doubt, madam, you
consider my conduct indecorous and brutal in the
extreme.&#8221; &#8220;I must confess,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;that
I did not expect such treatment from an officer; as,
in general, military men are ever disposed to show a
great degree of respect and deference to our sex.&#8221;
&#8220;You think me, then, a most perfect barbarian?
Answer me, frankly.&#8221; &#8220;If you really desire my
undisguised opinion on the subject,&#8221; said the lady,
&#8220;I must say that I think your conduct truly barbarous.&#8221;
&#8220;Madam,&#8221; was the answer, &#8220;I am entirely
of your opinion; but I only wished to give
you a specimen of the behavior and conduct of your
son, during <i>six months</i> that he resided in my house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
after the entrance of the French army into the Prussian
capital. I do not intend, however, to follow so
bad an example. You have full liberty, therefore, to
resume your apartment to-morrow, and I will seek
lodgings at some public hotel.&#8221; The lady retired,
quite satisfied that the officer was, after all, an honorable
man.</p>

<p>While passing through a small village, not far from
Cork, it was my fortune to be billeted, with two of
my comrades, in a house where the eldest daughter
was that evening to be married. The company had
already assembled, when, knocking at the door, we
presented our billets. The master of the house came
to meet his unwelcome guests. He offered us quite
a large sum to seek some other place for the night;
but, as we had obtained an inkling of what was going
forward, we declined. Of course, no alternative
remained but to receive us with as good a grace as
he could. I am happy to say, however, that we did
not forget what was due to our hosts, in the way of
decorum, although we joined in the merry dance, and
saluted the bride with soldier-like freedom. Money
was often made by the soldiers, when they chose to
do so, as they would frequently receive three, five,
or even ten shillings, for their tickets, and then furnish
themselves with cheaper lodgings elsewhere.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SEA-SICKNESS.</div>

<p>We arrived in Cork in September. This large city
is next in size to Dublin, and lies one hundred and
sixty-two miles to the south-west of it. It was originally
built upon an island, but in process of time it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
extended to both sides of the river. Its harbor is
nine miles from the city. It is a beautiful harbor,
very safe and capacious. Here we remained until
the middle of October, when we were ordered to sail
for England. The transport Lunar was sent to convey
us, and, having received her complement of men,
she was soon under way. Almost all on board were
new recruits, who were leaving Ireland for the first
time, and it was with various and deep emotions that
we watched her fast-receding shores. Mingled with
many sad recollections of parents, and home, and
friends, came dreams of future glory, the thirst for
martial fame, and anticipations of the happiness we
should enjoy in scenes far away, whose very distance
and indistinctness added, far more than exact reality
could have done, to the brightness of our hopes. But,
however golden might have been the visions that
filled our minds, we were certainly destined to realize
none of them on that day. Sea-sickness soon
sent us all to our berths, and a more miserable, woebegone
looking set than our company presented could
not easily be found. But though none of us felt
inclined to laugh, a looker-on might have found much
amusement, in the grotesque attitudes, the comical
grimaces, and the unavailing complaints, that resounded
on every side. But, however much the old
tars on board might have been disposed to make themselves
merry at our expense, the next day gave them
sufficient occupation in attending to their own affairs.
The morning that we left the beautiful harbor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Cork was fair and cloudless. The gentle breeze,
directly in our favor, carried us out into the channel
with an easy, gliding motion, that promised us a
short and pleasant voyage. But when, just at night,
weary of the confinement and confusion in our cabin,
I crept on deck, I saw the captain and mate conversing
in low and hurried accents, while the sailors were
watching the dark, portentous clouds, that lay piled
up against the horizon, gilded by the last rays of the
sun, which made their darkness seem still blacker.
The wind, which had been directly in our favor, now
tacked to the opposite quarter, and was blowing with
great fury, which increased before midnight to a perfect
hurricane. Our vessel, with its closely-reefed
sails, flew over the mountain waves, like a bird before
the storm. For two days and two nights the storm
continued, and our vessel seemed as a mere plaything
of the waves. On the third morning it became
almost unmanageable, and we had little hope of
reaching land in safety; but, as we came in sight
of the white cliffs of England, the storm subsided,
and our hopes again rose. Our captain tried hard to
reach our point of destination, but all his efforts
were fruitless, as the ship was almost a wreck. Giving
up this point, therefore, he succeeded in reaching
the little port of Pill, about four miles from Bristol,
where we landed in safety. I shall never forget the
emotion of joy which thrilled my heart when I found
myself once more on land; and I presume there
were none on board who did not, in some degree,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
share the feeling. From Pill we proceeded to Bristol,
where we remained a short time. We enjoyed
our stay in Bristol very much, as there were many
things that were new to us to attract our attention,
and we were not as closely watched as we had been
in Ireland. Our pay, while in England, was one
and sixpence daily,&mdash;the amount being increased,
as provisions were dearer than in Ireland.</p>

<p>From Bristol we were ordered to Plymouth, to
undergo the necessary but wearisome task of being
drilled,&mdash;a task not much more agreeable to our
officers than to ourselves. It would have indeed
required the patience of a Job to mould those raw
recruits, unaccustomed to confinement, and totally
unused to that subordination so positively necessary
in an army, into skilful and obedient soldiers. It
was, indeed, a tiresome task; and it was with no
small degree of pleasure that we learned that our
time had expired, and that we were soon to embark
for the Peninsula.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SAILS FOR THE PENINSULA.</div>

<div class="sidenote">A FIRE AT SEA.</div>

<p>The day at length arrived when we were actually
to sail. The last preparations had been made,&mdash;the
last stores taken in. Each ship (there were eleven
in the whole) received its living load, and then,
one after another, their white sails were spread, and
soon the fast-receding shores of England seemed but
a dim line, and then a mere speck on the horizon. It
was on the first day of January, 1811, that we bade
our long, and so many of us our last farewell, to the
shores of old England. On our own ship there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
twelve hundred of us,&mdash;a jovial, merry set. For
the first fourteen days nothing worthy of special notice
occurred, but then an accident happened which
came near costing us all our lives. It is the custom,
on board ships-of-war, to serve out every day spirit
rations to the men. On our ship, this was done at
eleven o&#8217;clock in the morning. A cask of liquor was
rolled on deck, the head knocked out, and the officer
whose duty it was served out to each of the mess a
measure of raw spirit. They usually came up, one by
one, received their measure, and then retired, either
to drink it themselves or to dispose of it to others,
who could always be found willing to purchase, which
was often done, when any of us had more than usual
need of money. On the morning to which I have
alluded, the 14th of January, one of the soldiers
walked up to the cask for his allowance with a
lighted pipe in his mouth, the coal from which he
dropped accidentally in the liquor. Almost in a moment
the whole deck was enveloped in flames. The
alarm was soon given, and every man on board did
his utmost to extinguish them; but the large quantity
of tar and other combustibles made this a task
not easily accomplished. The deck was soon flooded
with water, but the flames leaped up the ropes, and
caught on the rigging. In spite of all our efforts,
they still gained ground, and so rapidly that the
most daring of our number began to fear that we
were lost. As a last resource, each of the soldiers
caught their blankets, and throwing them wet on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
fire, and keeping them so, it was at length extinguished.
When this was completed, we gathered
the remains of our charred and ruined blankets, and,
throwing them into the sea, we retired to our naked
berths, grateful that, though suffering with cold, our
lives had been spared. It has often been my lot, in
the crowded city, to witness the raging flames, as
they leaped from house to house, carrying ruin and
desolation in their progress; I have gazed on the
ashes of palaces, beautiful but yesterday in their
magnificence, to which the ruthless torch of the midnight
incendiary had been applied; and I have often,
often been startled from the deep sleep of night, by
that fearful cry, which, in its very name, is the token
of suffering and sorrow;&mdash;but never&mdash;never do I
remember anything that thrilled to the depths of my
soul like that cry of fire, on the wild waste of
waters, where, unless it could be subdued, scarcely
a hope remained for the safety of those twelve hundred
human beings, confined in the ship&#8217;s narrow
space. On land, there must be at least a hope of
escape; and then we know that the warm sympathies
of active friends are enlisted in the sufferers&#8217; behalf,
and that all that man can do, to aid or save, will be
done. But when, far away on the sea, the red flames
are seen leaping from mast to mast, no summoning
bell tolls out its warning voice on the midnight air,&mdash;no
friendly crowds rush to the rescue; but the
little band of devoted ones on board must toil and
labor, with all that energy which the human spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
will summon up when life or death hang on the passing
moment, until the die is cast. Then, if all is at
last in vain, it but remains to choose a death by fire
or flood, or, too often, in the few that may escape by
the boats, a more lingering, but not less to be dreaded
fate, is met in death by starvation. But such was
not our destiny; and among all the narrow escapes
which it has been my lot in life to encounter, there
are no deliverances I remember with more gratitude
than the quenching of that fire on board our man-of-war.</p>

<p>In referring to this incident of my life, I have often
wondered that a custom so full of danger as that of
serving spirit out daily to such a body of men should
be continued. The frequent accidents to which I
allude are but a very small part of the evil; yet even
this is well worthy of being taken into consideration,
when we remember not only the pecuniary loss involved,
but the vast amount of human life which is
thus needlessly sacrificed. The moral evil is of far
greater magnitude. When I left home, I had never
formed the habit of drinking,&mdash;the taste of liquor
was positively disagreeable to me; and it was in compliance
with this custom that I first found a relish for
it. I can recall many, who now fill a drunkard&#8217;s
grave, who might trace back the commencement of
this sinful and ruinous habit to the same practice. It
is my humble opinion that much of the disobedience
and disrespectful language from the men might be
avoided, and consequently many of the punishments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
dispensed with, if this custom were wholly discontinued.
Besides, is it not encouraging this ruinous
habit, thus to place, as it were, the national seal
upon its usefulness and necessity, by thus furnishing
it to those employed, and especially just before a battle?
as if <i>that</i> were in any way necessary to infuse
a true spirit of courage! It is much to be hoped that
a decided reform will soon be effected here; and
that, while philanthropists are striving with such earnestness
to do away with much of the corporal punishment
formerly in vogue in both army and navy,
they will not forget the exciting cause which so often
operates to destroy entirely the force of moral restraint,
thus rendering physical coercion not only
advisable, but often absolutely necessary.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A TERRIFIC STORM.</div>

<p>While passing through the Bay of Biscay, we
encountered a terrific storm, which entirely scattered
our little fleet. Most of the time, since leaving home,
we had remained within hailing distance of each
other, messages often passing and repassing; but
when the storm burst upon us with so much fury,
the rest of the ships were quickly driven away.
Only one vessel remained in sight. It was the smallest
of our fleet, and we watched it with much anxiety,
as we could plainly see that it had undergone serious
injury. It was on the evening of the second day that
we heard the distant booming of her guns, through
the wild roar of the waters, announcing their perilous
situation, and imploring, if possible, aid. But
what could human arm avail, in a time like this?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Our own ship lay at the mercy of the waves. No
boat could live for one moment in those foaming and
raging waters; and so, with aching hearts, we were
compelled to look idly on, and see our countrymen
and fellow-soldiers about to be engulfed in a watery
grave. Night closed in; we could see that their condition
was hopeless; and, before nine, their last light
was extinguished, nor did we ever hear from them
again. In all probability, the whole crew of six
hundred men were lost.</p>

<p>The next morning the sun rose bright and beautiful,
and the moaning waves lashed themselves to rest
as peacefully as though their bright waters hid no
dark secrets, to be veiled from human view until the
sea shall give up its dead. The wind passed into a
favorable quarter, and the gentle breeze soon wafted
us on, until the high lands of Spain rose full on our
view. Accustomed to the level shores of Ireland, I
had never imagined scenery so beautiful as that which
appeared all along the coast, presenting a view said
to be the finest in the world. Our fleet, slowly collecting
together, now rounded the cape, and we soon
found ourselves in the Bay of Gibraltar. This bay is
eight miles long, and five wide. Every eye was on
the alert for the first view of that great rock, so
deservedly famous in English history; and we soon
saw it, rising, as it does, fifteen hundred feet out of
the sea, and extending over three miles. It is one
of the strongest fortifications in the world. It is
owned by the British government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">MONKEYS AT GIBRALTAR.</div>

<p>As our fleet dropped their anchors in this noble
harbor, we were welcomed at the fort by martial
salutes and loud huzzas, which were heartily returned.
It was with much pleasure that we found ourselves
at last in that land of which we had heard so much,
and where we hoped to witness, and participate in,
many deeds of glory. After marching, with flying
colors and beating drums, into the town, we were at
liberty to go where we pleased; and I soon found
myself, with a party of my countrymen, on the famous
rock. Rising perpendicularly out of the sea, it slopes
towards the shore, and is level for a few feet on the
top. On this level space are placed the cannon,
which command the whole entrance into the Mediterranean.
The dim outline of the African shore is
distinctly visible from its top. We were much
annoyed by the monkeys, that inhabit the rock in
great numbers. They are said to come over from
Africa, by a subterranean passage, under the Straits.
They were regarded almost as sacred by the inhabitants,
and a fine is imposed on any one who injures
or kills them. They sometimes attack their assailants
with stones, but oftener prefer stratagem to
valor,&mdash;running rapidly before their pursuers until,
by a sudden turn on some dizzy edge, they secure
themselves, and leave their pursuers to be dashed to
pieces on the rocks. They are often quite troublesome
to the soldiers and sentries, pelting them with
stones, and always ready to retaliate.</p>

<p>Gibraltar is called the key of the Mediterranean,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
because no force could possibly effect an entrance
without permission from the British government.
They have now mounted there over eight hundred
guns, and are intending to increase the number to
one thousand. The English territory in the south of
Spain is about four miles in extent. They obtained
possession of it only after severe struggles; but can
probably never be dispossessed by open force.</p>

<p>The Sabbath after we landed, the whole company
of men were paraded for church. We were all
ordered to attend the service of the Church of England.
As I had been brought up a strict Catholic,
and as there was a church of that persuasion in the
place, to which I intended going, I did not respond
to the call, but remained in my quarters. I had
been here but a short time, when the sergeant came
in, and asked why I did not go to church. I told
him I could not attend the service of his church
while there was one of my own denomination in the
place. He replied that it was a rule of the army,
and I must submit to it. But I still declined to go,
when he went out and reported to the adjutant that
I had refused to obey orders. The adjutant then
came in, and asked me the same question. I told him
that I was not a member of the Church of England,
but a Catholic. If I could be permitted, I would
gladly attend my own church, but could not be present
at the service. At this the adjutant was very
angry, and ordered me into confinement. Here I
had leisure to reflect on the probable consequences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
of the step I had taken. Punishment of some kind
was certain; and, judging from the angry appearance
and words of the adjutant, I certainly had no
reason to think it would be a light one. But what
right has England, I asked myself, to compel those
who fight her battles to worship as she worships?
My conscience told me that she had none. I felt
that my cause was just, and I determined to persevere,
whatever might be the result. The next day
I was summoned before a court-martial, tried, and
sentenced to receive three hundred lashes on the
succeeding day. As, perhaps, some of my young
readers have not much idea of this punishment, I will
describe it to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">A FLOGGING.</div>

<p>A triangle was erected, composed of three poles,
fastened at the top with an iron bolt. To two of
these the legs and hands of the sufferer are designed
to be fastened, while a board is placed across for the
breast to lean upon. The troops were then marched
out, and formed a large hollow square around the
place of punishment. I was then brought to the
place, under guard of a file of soldiers, commanded
by an officer. My clothes were so far removed as to
leave me naked to the waist, and I was bound to the
triangle. Turning to the first soldier on the file, the
officer directed that he should proceed to duty. He
laid aside his coat, and applied twenty-five lashes,
with the cat-o&#8217;-nine-tails, to my back. These blows
were counted by the officer. After twenty-five had
been applied, I was asked if I would give up; I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
answered, &#8220;No!&#8221; The blood was already flowing
freely from my back, yet I resolved to die rather than
submit to what appeared to me so unjust a requirement.
The next soldier then took the lash, and
struck twenty-five times. Again the officer asked if
I would yield, and received the same reply; and this
was continued until the whole three hundred had
been inflicted. I was then taken down, more dead
than alive, and sent to the hospital to be cured of my
wounds,&mdash;a process usually requiring from six weeks
to three months. The cat&mdash;the instrument with
which this punishment is inflicted&mdash;is composed of
nine small cords, twisted very hard, and having three
knots on each cord; sometimes the ends of these
are bound with wire. The whip is usually about
eighteen inches long, and the handle fifteen.</p>

<p>As soon as I was able, I wrote to his Royal Highness
the Duke of York, stating my case, and requesting
permission for those who preferred attending
their own churches to do so. I was much gratified
to learn that his Highness took the matter into consideration;
and, soon after, sent an order that the
soldiers should be permitted to attend church where
they pleased. I have always had the consolation,
when looking back on that scene of severe and unjust
suffering, of thinking that it was instrumental in
procuring liberty of conscience to many who might
never have enjoyed it without.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SUFFERING.</div>

<p>I remained at the hospital until our troops were
ordered to march, which was only three or four weeks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Of course, the wounds were only partially healed, and
I was obliged to shoulder my knapsack while they
were still raw and sore. This constant irritation
prevented their healing, and the suffering I endured
from this cause I considered nearly as great as that
from the punishment itself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> entering into a particular account of the

be uninteresting to my readers to take a hasty survey
of the war which was now raging in the Peninsula,

doing this, I can, of course, in so small a work, only
allude to its principal events, and relate some anecdotes,
interesting, as well from their authenticity, as
from the patriotism of which they were such bright
examples.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ORIGIN OF THE PENINSULAR WAR.</div>

<p>Charles IV., a descendant of the Spanish Bourbons,
in 1807, occupied the throne of Spain. He
was feeble in mind, impotent in action, and extremely
dissolute in his habits. Writing to Napoleon, he
gives an account of himself which must have filled
with contempt the mind of the hard-working emperor
for the imbecile king who thus disgraced a throne.
&#8220;Every day,&#8221; says he, &#8220;winter as well as summer,
I go out to shoot, from morning till noon. I then
dine, and return to the chase, which I continue till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
sunset. Manuel Godoy then gives me a brief account
of what is going on, and I go to bed, to recommence
the same life on the morrow.&#8221; His wife, Louisa,
was a shameless profligate. She had selected, from
the body-guard of the king, a young soldier, named
Godoy, as her principal favorite; and had freely lavished
on him both wealth and honors. He was known
as the Prince of Peace. A favorite of the king, as
well as queen, the realm was, in reality, governed
by him. Ferdinand, Prince of the Asturias, and heir
to the throne, hated this favorite. Weak, unprincipled,
and ambitious, unwilling to wait until the crown
should become his by inheritance, it is said that he
concerted a scheme to remove both his parents by
poison. He was arrested, and imprisoned. Natural
affection was entirely extinct in the bosoms of his
parents. Louisa, speaking of her son, said that &#8220;he
had a mule&#8217;s head and a tiger&#8217;s heart;&#8221; and history
informs us that if injustice is done here, it is only to
the tiger and mule. Both king and queen did all
they could to cover his name with obloquy, and prepare
the nation for his execution. But the popular
voice was with Ferdinand. The rule of the base-born
favorite could not be tolerated by the Spanish hidalgos;
and the nation, groaning under the burdens
that the vices and misrule of Charles had brought
upon them, looked with hope to the youth, whose
very abandonment had excited an interest in his
favor. From the depths of his prison he wrote to
Napoleon, imploring his aid, and requesting an alliance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
with his family. Charles, too, invoked the assistance
&#8220;of the hero destined by Providence to save
Europe and support thrones.&#8221; A secret treaty was
concluded between the emperor and Charles, whose
object was nominally the conquest of Portugal; and
thus French troops were brought to Madrid. A
judicial investigation was held on the charge against
Ferdinand, which ended in the submission of that
prince to his parents. But the intrigues of the two
parties still continued. In March, 1808, hatred of
Godoy, and contempt of the king, had increased to
such a degree, that the populace of Madrid could no
longer be controlled. The palace of the Prince of
Peace was broken open and sacked. The miserable
favorite, allowed scarcely a moment&#8217;s warning of the
coming storm, had barely time to conceal himself
beneath a pile of old mats, in his garret. Here, for
thirty-six hours, he lay, shivering with terror and
suffering. Unable longer to endure the pangs of
thirst, he crept down from his hiding-place, was
seen, and dragged out by the mob. A few select
troops of the king rushed to his rescue; and, half
dead with fright and bruises, he was thrown into
prison. The populace, enraged by the loss of their
victim, now threatened to attack the palace. Charles,
alarmed for his own safety, abdicated in favor of
Ferdinand, and that prince was proclaimed king, amid
the greatest rejoicings. But Charles wrote to Napoleon
that his abdication was a forced one, and again
implored his aid. Soon after, determined to advocate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
his cause in person, he went to Bayonne to meet
the emperor, accompanied by Louisa and Godoy, and,
with them, his two younger sons. Ferdinand, jealous
of his father&#8217;s influence with Napoleon, determined
to confront him there. His people everywhere
declared against this measure. They cut the traces
of his carriage; they threw themselves before the
horses, imploring him, with prayers and tears, not to
desert his people. But Ferdinand went on. The
emperor received them all with kindness. In a private
interview with him, Charles, Louisa, and Godoy,
willingly exchanged their rights to the uneasy crown
of Spain for a luxurious home in Italy, where money
for the gratification of all their voluptuous desires
should be at their command. Ferdinand and his two
brothers, Carlos and Francisco, were not so easily
persuaded to surrender the crown of their ancestors.
But Napoleon&#8217;s iron will at length prevailed, and the
three brothers remained not unwilling prisoners in
the castle of Valencey. The throne of Spain was
now vacant. The right to fill it was assumed by the
emperor, in virtue of the cession to him, by Charles,
of his rights. The council of Castile, the municipality
of Madrid, and the governing junta, in obedience
to Napoleon&#8217;s dictate, declared that their choice had
fallen upon Joseph Bonaparte, King of Naples. He
was already on his way to Bayonne. On the 20th
of July he entered Madrid; and, on the 24th, he
was proclaimed King of Spain and the Indies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SIEGE OF SARAGOSSA.</div>

<p>But, if the rulers of Spain, and a few of her pusillanimous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
nobles, had agreed to accept a king of Napoleon&#8217;s
choice, not so decided the great body of the
people. They everywhere flew to arms. To acknowledge
the authority of the self-constituted government,
was to declare one&#8217;s self an enemy to the
nation. Assassinations at Cadiz and Seville were
imitated in every part of Spain. Grenada had its
murders; Carthagena rivalled Cadiz in ruthless cruelty;
and Valencia reeked with blood. In Gallicia,
the people assembled and endeavored to oblige their
governor to declare war against France. Prompted
by prudence, he advised them to delay. Enraged at
this, the ferocious soldiers seized him, and, planting
their weapons in the earth, tossed him on their
points, and left him to die. In Asturias, two noblemen
were selected, and sent to implore the assistance
of England. In England, the greatest enthusiasm
prevailed. The universal rising of the Spanish nation
was regarded as a pledge of their patriotism,
and aid and assistance was immediately promised and
given. Napoleon, with his usual promptness, poured
his troops into Spain. They were successful in many
places; but the enemy, always forming in small numbers,
if easily defeated, soon appeared in another
place. The first permanent stand was made at Saragossa.
Palafox had, with some hastily gathered followers,
disputed the passage of the Ebro, and, routed
by superior force, had fallen back upon this city,
whose heroic defence presents acts of daring courage
of which the world&#8217;s history scarcely furnishes a parallel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
It was regularly invested by the French,
under Lefebre Desnouttes. The city had no regular
defences, but the houses were very strong, being
vaulted so as to be nearly fire-proof, and the massy
walls of the convents afforded security to the riflemen
who filled them. The French troops had at one
time nearly gained possession of the town, but, for
some unknown reasons, they fell back. This gave
confidence to the besieged. They redoubled their
exertions. All shared the labor,&mdash;women, children,
priests and friars, labored for the common cause,&mdash;and
in twenty-four hours the defences were so strengthened
that the place was prepared to stand a siege.
But the next morning Palafox imprudently left the
city, and offered battle to the French. He was, of
course, quickly beaten; but succeeded in escaping,
with a few of his troops, into the city. A small hill
rises close to the convent of St. Joseph&#8217;s, called Monte
Torrero. Some stone houses on this hill were strongly
fortified, and occupied by twelve hundred men. This
place was attacked by Lefebre, and taken by assault,
on the 27th of June, 1808. The convents of St.
Joseph&#8217;s and the Capuchins were next attacked by the
French, and, after a long resistance, taken by storm.
The command of the besiegers was now transferred to
General Verdier. He continued the siege during the
whole of July, making several assaults on the gates,
from which he was repulsed, with great loss. The
Spaniards, having received a reinforcement, made a
sortie to retake Monte Torrero; but were defeated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
their commander killed, and most of their number
left dead. On the 2d of August, the enemy opened
a dreadful fire on the town. One of their shells
lighted upon the powder magazine, which was in the
most secure part of the city, and blew it up, destroying
many houses and killing numbers of the
besieged. The carnage, during this siege, was truly
terrible. Six hundred women and children perished,
and above forty thousand men were killed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MAID OF SARAGOSSA.</div>

<p>It was at this place that the act of female heroism
so beautifully celebrated by Byron was performed.
An assault had been made upon one of the gates,
which was withstood with great courage by the besieged.
At the battery of the Portillo, their fire had
been so fatal, that but one artillery-man remained
able to serve the gun. He seemed to bear a charmed
life. Though shot and shell fell thick and fast around
him, he still stood unharmed, and rapidly loaded and
discharged his gun. At length, worn out by his own
exertions, his strength seemed about to fail. There
was little time, in a contest like this, to watch for the
safety of others; but there was one eye near which
not for a moment lost sight of him. Augustina, a
girl twenty-two years of age, had followed her daring
lover to his post. She would not leave him
there alone, although every moment exposed her to
share his death. When she saw his strength begin
to fail, she seized a cordial, and held it to his lips.
In the very act of receiving it, the fatal death-stroke
came, and he fell dead at her feet. Not for a moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
paused the daring maid. No tear fell for the
slain. She lived to do what he had done. Snatching
a match from the hand of a dead artillery-man,
she fired off the gun, and swore never to quit it
alive, during the siege. The soldiers and citizens,
who had begun to retire, stimulated by so heroic an
example, rushed to the battery a second time, and
again opened a tremendous fire upon the enemy.
For this daring act, Augustina received a small shield
of honor, and had the word &#8220;Saragossa&#8221; embroidered
on the sleeve of her dress, with the pay of an
artillery-man. Byron thus commemorates this heroism,
in his own transcendent manner:</p>

<div class="sidenote">DESPERATE CONFLICT.</div>

<p>On the 4th of August, the French stormed the
city, and penetrated as far as the Corso, or public
square. Here a terrible conflict was maintained.
Every inch of ground was manfully contested; but
the enemy&#8217;s cavalry was irresistible, and the besieged
began to give way. All appeared lost. The
French, thinking the victory gained, began to plunder.
Seeing this, the besieged rallied, and attacked
them. They succeeded in driving the enemy back
to the Corso. They also set fire to the convent of
Francisco, and many perished in its conflagration.
Night now came, to add its horrors to the scene. The
fierce contest still raged on. The lunatic asylum
was invaded, and soon the dread cry of &#8220;Fire&#8221;
mingled with the incoherent ravings of its inmates.
&#8220;Here,&#8221; says one writer, &#8220;were to be seen grinning
maniacs, shouting with hideous joy, and mocking the
cries of the wounded; there, others, with seeming
delight, were dabbling in the crimson fluid of many
a brave heart, which had scarcely ceased to beat.
On one side, young and lovely women, dressed in the
fantastic rigging of a mind diseased, were bearing
away headless trunks and mutilated limbs, which lay
scattered around them, while the unearthly cries of
the idiot kept up a hideous concert with the shouts
of the infuriated combatants. In short, it was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
scene of unmingled horror, too fearful for the mind
to dwell upon.&#8221; After a severe contest and dreadful
carnage, the French forced their way into the Corso,
in the very centre of the city, and before night were
in possession of one-half of it. Lefebre now believed
that he had effected his purpose, and required
Palafox to surrender, in a note containing only these
words: &#8220;Headquarters, St. Engrucia,&mdash;Capitulation.&#8221;
Equally laconic the brave Spaniard&#8217;s answer
was: &#8220;Headquarters, Saragossa,&mdash;War to the
knife&#8217;s point.&#8221;</p>

<p>The contest which was now carried on stands
unparalleled. One side of the Corso was held by the
French soldiery; the opposite was in possession of
the Arragonese, who erected batteries at the end of
the cross-streets, within a few paces of those the
French had thrown up. The space between these
was covered with the dead. Next day, the powder
of the besieged began to fail; but even this dismayed
them not. One cry broke from the people,
whenever Palafox came among them, &#8220;War to the
knife!&mdash;no capitulation.&#8221; The night was coming
on, and still the French continued their impetuous
onsets. But now the brother of Palafox entered the
city with a convoy of arms and ammunition, and a
reinforcement of three thousand men. This succor
was as unexpected as it was welcome, and raised the
desperate courage of the citizens to the highest pitch
of enthusiasm. The war was now carried on from
street to street, and even from room to room. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
priest, by the name of Santiago Suss, displayed the
most undaunted bravery, fighting at the head of the
besieged, and cheering and consoling the wounded
and the dying. At the head of forty chosen men,
he succeeded in procuring a supply of powder for the
town, and, by united stratagem and courage, effected
its entrance, even through the French lines. This
murderous contest was continued for eleven successive
days and nights,&mdash;more, indeed, by night than
by day, for it was almost certain death to appear by
daylight within reach of houses occupied by the other
party. But, concealed by the darkness of the night,
they frequently dashed across the street, to attack
each other&#8217;s batteries; and the battle, commenced
there, was often carried into the houses beyond, from
room to room, and from floor to floor. As if not
enough of suffering had accompanied this memorable
siege, a new scourge came to add its horrors to the
scene. Pestilence, with all its accumulated terrors,
burst upon the doomed city. Numbers of putrescent
bodies, in various stages of decomposition, were strewed
thickly around the spot where the death-struggle was
still going on. The air was impregnated with the
pestiferous miasm of festering mortality; and this,
too, in a climate like Spain, and in the month of
August! This evil must be removed,&mdash;but how?
Certain death would have been the penalty of any
Arragonese who should attempt it. The only remedy
was to tie ropes to the French prisoners, and,
pushing them forward amid the dead and dying,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
compel them to remove the bodies, and bring them
away for interment. Even for this office, as necessary
to one party as the other, there was no truce;
only the prisoners were better secured, by the compassion
of their countrymen, from the fire.</p>

<p>From day to day, this heroic defence was kept up,
with unremitting obstinacy. In vain breaches were
made and stormed; the besiegers were constantly
repulsed. At last Verdier received orders to retire;
and the French, after reducing the city almost to
ashes, were compelled to abandon their attacks, and
retreat.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, all over Spain the contest was continued,
and everywhere with the most unsparing cruelty.
Her purest and noblest sons often fell victims
to private malice. &#8220;No one&#8217;s life,&#8221; says one author,
&#8220;was worth a week&#8217;s purchase.&#8221; One anecdote
may serve as an example to illustrate the spirit
of the times.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ANECDOTE.</div>

<p>It was night. The rays of the full moon shed
their beautiful light on the hills of the Sierra Morena.
On one of these hills lay a small division of the patriotic
army. Its chief was a dark, fierce-looking
man, in whose bosom the spirit of human kindness
seemed extinct forever. A brigand, who had long
dealt in deeds of death, he had placed himself without
the pale even of the laws of Spain. But, when
the war commenced, he had offered his own services
and that of his men against the French, and had been
accepted. On this night he sat, wrapped in his huge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
cloak, beside the decaying watch-fire, seemingly deep
in thought. Near him lay a prisoner on the grass,
with the knotted cords so firmly bound around his
limbs that the black blood seemed every moment
ready to burst from its enclosure. He might have
groaned aloud in his agony, had not the pride of his
nation,&mdash;for he, too, was a Spaniard,&mdash;and his own
deep courage, prevented. His crime was, that, yielding
to the promptings of humanity, he had shown
kindness to a wounded French officer, and had thus
drawn upon himself suspicion of favoring their cause.
Short trial was needed, in those days, to doom a man
to death; and, with the morning&#8217;s dawn, the brave
Murillo was informed that he must die.</p>

<p>With closed eyes and a calm countenance, his
heart was yet filled with agony, as he remembered
his desolated home and his defenceless little ones.
Suddenly, a light footstep was heard in the wood
adjoining. The sentinel sprang to his feet, and
demanded, &#8220;Who goes there?&#8221; A boy, over whose
youthful brow scarce twelve summers could have
passed, answered the summons. &#8220;I would speak
with your chief,&#8221; he said. The ruthless man raised
his head as the boy spoke this; and, not waiting for
an answer, he sprang forward and stood before him.
&#8220;What is your errand here, boy?&#8221; asked the brigand.
&#8220;I come a suppliant for my father&#8217;s life,&#8221; he
said, pointing to the prisoner on the grass. &#8220;He
dies with the morrow&#8217;s sun,&#8221; was the unmoved reply.
&#8220;Nay, chieftain, spare him, for my mother&#8217;s sake,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
and for her children. Let <i>him</i> live, and, if you must
have blood, I will die for him;&#8221; and the noble boy
threw himself at the feet of the chief, and looked up
imploringly in his face. &#8220;He is so good!&mdash;You smile:
you will save his life!&#8221; &#8220;You speak lightly of life,&#8221;
said the stern man, &#8220;and you know little of death.
Are you willing to lose one of your ears, for your
father&#8217;s sake?&#8221; &#8220;I am,&#8221; said the boy, and he
removed his cap, and fixed his eyes on his father&#8217;s
face. Not a single tear fell, as the severed member,
struck off by the chief&#8217;s hand, lay at his feet. &#8220;You
bear it bravely, boy; are you willing to lose the
other?&#8221; &#8220;If it will save my father&#8217;s life,&#8221; was
the unfaltering response. A moment more, and the
second one lay beside its fellow, while yet not a
groan, or word expressive of suffering, passed the
lips of the noble child. &#8220;Will you now release my
father?&#8221; he asked, as he turned to the prostrate
man, whose tears, which his own pain had no power
to bring forth, fell thick and fast, as he witnessed the
bravery of his unoffending son. For a moment it
seemed that a feeling of compassion had penetrated
the flinty soul of the man of blood. But, if the spark
had fallen, it glimmered but a moment on the cold
iron of that heart, and then went out forever.
&#8220;Before I release him, tell me who taught you thus
to endure suffering.&#8221; &#8220;My father,&#8221; answered the
boy. &#8220;Then that father must die; for Spain is not
safe while he lives to rear such children.&#8221; And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
before the morning dawned father and son slept their
last sleep.</p>

<p>While Lefebre and Verdier were prosecuting the
fatal siege of Saragossa, Marshal Bessières was pursuing
his victorious course in Castile, compelling one
force after another to acknowledge the authority of
Joseph. General Duhesme and Marshal Moncey, in
Catalonia, met with varied success;&mdash;repulsed at
Valencia and at Gerona, they yet met with enough
good fortune to maintain their reputation as generals.
In Andalusia, the French army, under Dupont, met
with serious reverses. At Baylen, eighteen thousand
men laid down their arms, only stipulating that they
should be sent to France. This capitulation, disgraceful
in itself to the French, was shamefully
broken. Eighty of the officers were murdered, at
Lebrixa, in cold blood; armed only with their
swords, they kept their assassins some time at bay,
and succeeded in retreating into an open space in the
town, where they endeavored to defend themselves;
but, a fire being opened upon them from the surrounding
houses, the last of these unfortunate men were
destroyed. The rest of the troops were marched to
Cadiz, and many died on the road. Those who
survived the march were treated with the greatest
indignity, and cast into the hulks, at that port. Two
years afterwards, a few hundreds of them escaped,
by cutting the cables of their prison-ship, and drifting
in a storm upon a lee shore. The remainder
were sent to the desert island of Cabrera, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
clothing, without provisions, with scarcely any water,
and there died by hundreds. It is related that some
of them dug several feet into the solid stone with a
single knife, in search of water. They had no
shelter, nor was there any means of providing it.
At the close of the war, when returning peace caused
an exchange of prisoners, only a few hundred of all
those thousands remained alive. This victory at
Baylen greatly encouraged the Spanish troops,
whose ardor was beginning to fail, before the conquering
career of Bessières, and the disgust and terror
occasioned by the murders and excesses of the
populace. When the news of the capitulation
reached Madrid, Joseph called a council of war, and
it was decided that the French should abandon
Madrid, and retire behind the Ebro.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FRENCH SUCCESSES IN PORTUGAL.</div>

<p>But if the French arms had met with a reverse in
Spain, it was compensated by their success in Portugal.
Junôt, at the head of twenty-five thousand
men, marched from Alcantara to Lisbon. At an
unfavorable season of the year, and encountering
fatigue, and want, and tempests, that daily thinned
his ranks, until of his whole force only two thousand
remained, he yet entered Lisbon victorious. This
city contained three hundred thousand inhabitants,
and fourteen thousand regular troops were collected
there. A powerful British fleet was at the mouth of
the harbor, and its commander, Sir Sidney Smith,
offered his powerful aid, in resisting the French; yet
such was the terror that Napoleon&#8217;s name excited,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
and such the hatred of their rulers, that the people
of Lisbon yielded, almost without a struggle. When
Napoleon, in his Moniteur, made the startling announcement
that &#8220;the house of Braganza had ceased
to reign,&#8221; the feeble prince-regent, alarmed for his
own safety, embarked, with his whole court, and sailed
for the Brazils. Junôt himself was created Duke of
Abrantes, and made governor-general of the kingdom.
He exerted himself to give an efficient
government to Portugal; and met with such success,
that a strong French interest was created, and steps
were actually taken to have Prince Eugene declared
King of Portugal. The people themselves, and the
literary men, were in favor of this step; but it met
with the strongest opposition from the priests, and
this was nurtured and fanned into a flame by persons
in the pay of the English, whose whole influence
was exerted in making Napoleon&#8217;s name and nation
as odious to the people as possible. Among a
people so superstitious as the Portuguese, the monks
would, of course, exert great influence; and many
were the prodigies which appeared, to prove that
their cause was under the protection of Heaven.
Among others, was that of an egg, marked by some
chemical process, with certain letters, which were
interpreted to indicate the coming of Don Sebastian,
King of Portugal. This adventurous monarch, years
before, earnestly desirous of promoting the interests
of his country, and of the Christian religion, had
raised a large army, consisting of the flower of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
nobility, and the choicest troops of his kingdom, and
crossed the Straits into Africa, for the purpose of
waging war with the Moorish king. Young, ardent
and inexperienced, he violated every dictate of prudence,
by marching into the enemy&#8217;s country to meet
an army compared with which his own was a mere
handful. The whole of his army perished, and his
own fate was never known. But, as his body was
not found among the dead, the peasantry of Portugal,
ardently attached to their king, believed that he
would some time return, and deliver his country from
all their woes. He was supposed to be concealed
in a secret island, waiting the destined period, in
immortal youth. The prophecy of the egg was,
therefore, believed; and people, even of the higher
classes, were often seen on the highest points of the
hills, looking towards the sea with earnest gaze, for
the appearance of the island where their long-lost
hero was detained.</p>

<div class="sidenote">STATE OF AFFAIRS IN PORTUGAL.</div>

<p>The constant efforts of the English and the priests
at length had their effect, in arousing the Portuguese
peasantry into action; and the news of the insurrection
in Spain added new fuel to the flame. The
Spaniards in Portugal immediately rose against the
French; and their situation would have become dangerous
in the extreme, had not the promptness and
dexterity of Junôt succeeded in averting the danger
for the present. Such was the state of affairs in the
Peninsula, when the English troops made their
descent into Spain. It has often been said that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
England was moved by pure patriotism, or by a
strong desire to relieve the Spanish nation, in being
thus prodigal of her soldiers and treasures; but
her hatred to Napoleon, and her determination, at
all hazards, to put a stop to his growing power,
was, in all probability, the real motive that influenced
her to bestow aid upon that people.</p>

<p>The English collected their army of nine thousand
in Cork, in June, 1808. Sir Hugh Dalrymple had,
nominally the chief command of the army, and Sir
Harry Burrard the second; but the really acting
officers were, Sir Arthur Wellesley and Sir John
Moore. These troops disembarked at the Mondego
river on the first of August, and marching along the
coast, proceeded to Rolica, where they determined
to give battle to the French. Junôt, having left in
Lisbon a sufficient force to hold the revolutionary
movement in check, placed himself at the head of
his army, and advanced to the contest. He was not,
however, present at the battle of Rolica. The
French troops were under the command of Generals
Loison and Laborde. Nearly in the centre of the
heights of Rolica stands an old Moorish castle. This,
and every favorable post on the high ground, was
occupied by detachments of the French army. It
was a strong position; but Sir Arthur, anxious to
give battle before the two divisions of the French
army should effect a junction, decided upon an immediate
attack.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BATTLE OF ROLICA.</div>

<p>It was morning, and a calm and quiet beauty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
seemed to linger on the scene of the impending
conflict. The heights of Rolica, though steep and
difficult of access, possess few of the sterner and more
imposing features of mountain scenery. The heat of
summer had deprived them of much of that brightness
of verdure common in a colder climate. Here
and there the face of the heights was indented by
deep ravines, worn by the winter torrents, the precipitous
banks of which were occasionally covered
with wood, and below extended groves of the cork-tree
and olive; while Obidas, with its ancient walls
and fortress, and stupendous aqueduct, rose in the
middle distance. In the east Mount Junto reared
its lofty summit, while on the west lay the broad
Atlantic. And this was the battle-ground that was
to witness the first outpouring of that blood which
flowed so profusely, on both sides, during the progress
of this long and desolating war. Sir Arthur had
divided his army into three columns, of which he
himself commanded the centre, Colonel Trant the
right, while the left, directed against Loison, was
under General Ferguson. The centre marched against
Laborde, who was posted on the elevated plain. This
general, perceiving, at a glance, that his position was
an unfavorable one, evaded the danger by falling
rapidly back to the heights of Zambugeria, where he
could only be approached by narrow paths, leading
through deep ravines. A swarm of skirmishers,
starting forward, soon plunged into the passes; and,
spreading to the right and left, won their way among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the rocks and tangled evergreens that overspread the
steep ascent, and impeded their progress.</p>

<p>With still greater difficulty the supporting column
followed, their formation being disordered in the
confined and rugged passes, while the hollows echoed
with the continual roar of musketry, and the shouts
of the advancing troops were loudly answered by the
enemy, while the curling smoke, breaking out from
the side of the mountain, marked the progress of
the assailants, and showed how stoutly the defence
was maintained. The right of the 29th arrived first
at the top; and, ere it could form, Col. Lake was
killed, and a French company, falling on their flanks,
broke through, carrying with them fifty or sixty
prisoners. Thus pressed, this regiment fell back,
and, re-forming under the hill, again advanced to the
charge. At the same time, General Ferguson poured
his troops upon the other side of the devoted army.
Laborde, seeing it impossible to effect a junction with
Loison, or to maintain his present position, fell back,&mdash;commencing
his retreat by alternate masses, and
protecting his movements by vigorous charges of
cavalry,&mdash;and halted at the Quinta de Bugagleira,
where his scattered detachments rejoined him. From
this place he marched all night, to gain the position
of Montechique, leaving three guns on the field of
battle, and the road to Torres Vedras open to the
victors. The French lost six hundred men, killed
and wounded, among the latter of which was the
gallant Laborde himself. Although the English were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
victors in this strife, the heroic defence of the French
served to show them that they had no mean enemy
to contend with. The personal enmity to Napoleon,
and the violent party prejudices in England, were so
great, that the most absurd stories as to the want of
order and valor in his troops gained immediate credence
there; and many of the English army believed
that they had but to show themselves, and the French
would fly. The bravery with which their attack
was met was, of course, a matter of great surprise,
and served as an efficient check to that rashness
which this erroneous belief had engendered.</p>

<p>Instead of pursuing this victory, as Wellesley would
have done, he was obliged to go to the seashore, to
protect the landing of General Anstruthers and his
troops. After having effected a junction with this
general, he marched to Vimiero, where the French,
under Junôt, arrived on the 21st of August. The
following brief and vivid sketch of this combat is
taken from Alexander&#8217;s Life of Wellington:</p>

<div class="sidenote">BATTLE OF VIMIERO.</div>

<p>&#8220;Vimiero is a village, pleasantly situated in a
gentle and quiet valley, through which flows the
small river of Maceria. Beyond, and to the westward
and northward of this village, rises a mountain,
of which the western point reaches the sea; the
eastern is separated by a deep ravine from the
height, over which passes the road that leads from
Lourinha and the northward to Vimiero. On this
mountain were posted the chief part of the infantry,
with eight pieces of artillery. General Hill&#8217;s brigade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
was on the right, and Ferguson&#8217;s on the left, having
one battalion on the heights, separated from them by
the mountain. Towards the east and south of the
town lay a mill, wholly commanded by the mountain
on the west side, and commanding, also, the surrounding
ground to the south and east, on which
General Fane was posted, with his riflemen, and the
50th regiment, and General Anstruthers&#8217; brigade,
with the artillery, which had been ordered to that
position during the night.</p>

<p>&#8220;About eight o&#8217;clock a picket of the enemy&#8217;s
horse was first seen on the heights, toward Lourinha;
and, after pushing forward his scouts, soon appeared
in full force, with the evident object of attacking the
British.</p>

<p>&#8220;Immediately four brigades, from the mountains
on the east, moved across the ravine to the heights
on the road to Lourinha, with three pieces of cannon.
They were formed with their right resting upon these
heights, and their left upon a ravine which separates
the heights from a range at Maceria. On these
heights were the Portuguese troops, and they were
supported by General Crawford&#8217;s brigade.</p>

<p>&#8220;The enemy opened his attack, in strong columns,
against the entire body of troops on this height. On
the left they advanced, through the fire of the riflemen,
close up to the 50th regiment, until they were
checked and driven back by that regiment, at the
point of the bayonet. The French infantry, in these
divisions, was commanded by Laborde, Loison, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Kellerman, and the horse by General Margaron.
Their attack was simultaneous, and like that of a man
determined to conquer or to perish. Besides the conflict
on the heights, the battle raged with equal fury
on every part of the field. The possession of the
road leading into Vimiero was disputed with persevering
resolution, and especially where a strong body
had been posted in the church-yard, to prevent the
enemy forcing an entrance into the town. Up to
this period of the battle the British had received and
repulsed the attacks of the enemy, acting altogether
on the defensive. But now they were attacked in
flank by General Ackland&#8217;s brigade, as it advanced
to its position on the height to the left, while a brisk
cannonade was kept up by the artillery on those
heights.</p>

<p>&#8220;The brunt of the attack was continued on the
brigade of General Fane, but was bravely repulsed at
all points. Once, as the French retired in confusion,
a regiment of light dragoons pursued them with so
little precaution, that they were suddenly set upon
by the heavy cavalry of Margaron, and cut to pieces,
with their gallant colonel at their head.</p>

<p>&#8220;No less desperate was the encounter between
Kellerman&#8217;s column of reserve and the gallant 43d,
in their conflict for the vineyard adjoining the church.
The advanced companies were at first driven back,
with great slaughter; but, again rallying upon the
next ranks, they threw themselves upon the head of
a French column in a ravine, and, charging with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
bayonet, put them to the rout. At length the vigor
of the enemy&#8217;s attack ceased. They, pressed on all
sides by the British, had lost thirteen cannons and a
great number of prisoners; but were still enabled to
retire without confusion, owing to the protection of
their numerous cavalry. An incident occurred in
this battle, so highly characteristic of Highland courage,
that I cannot refrain from quoting it. It is
very common for the wounded to cheer their more
fortunate comrades, as they pass on to the attack. A
man named Stewart, the piper of the 71st regiment,
was wounded in the thigh, very severely, at an early
period of the action, and refused to be removed. He
sat upon a bank, playing martial airs, during the
remainder of the battle. As a party of his comrades
were passing, he addressed them thus: &#8216;Weel, my
brave lads, I can gang na langer wi&#8217; ye a fightin&#8217;,
but ye shall na want music.&#8217; On his return home,
the Highland Society voted him a handsome set of
pipes, with a flattering inscription engraved on them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The total loss of the French was estimated at
three thousand. Soon after the battle, General Kellerman
presented himself, with a strong body of
cavalry, at the outposts, and demanded an interview
with the English general. The result of this interview
was the famous convention of Cintra. By it, it
was stipulated that Portugal should be delivered up
to the British army, and the French should evacuate
it, with arms and baggage, but not as prisoners of
war; that the French should be transported, by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
British, into their own country; that the army should
carry with it all its artillery, cavalry, arms, and ammunition,
and the soldiers all their private property.
It also provided that the Portuguese who had favored
the French party should not be punished.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FRENCH EVACUATE PORTUGAL.</div>

<p>According to the terms of this convention, Junôt,
on the 2d of September, yielded the government of
the capital. This suspension of military rule was
followed by a wild scene of anarchy and confusion.
The police disbanded of their own accord, and crime
stalked abroad on every side. Lisbon was illuminated
with thousands of little lamps, at their departure;
and such was the state of the public mind, that
Sir John Hope was obliged to make many and severe
examples, before he succeeded in restoring order.</p>

<p>On the 13th, the Duke of Abrantes embarked,
with his staff; and by the 30th of September only
the garrisons of Elvas and Almeida remained in Portugal.
This convention was very unpopular in England.
The whole voice of the press was against it;
and such was the state of feeling, that Sir Harry
Burrard and Sir Hugh Dalrymple were both recalled,
to present themselves before a court of inquiry, instituted
for the occasion. After a minute investigation,
these generals were declared innocent, but it was
judged best to detain them at home.</p>

<p>Having seen Portugal under the control of the
English, let us return to the affairs of Spain. Immediately
after the battle of Baylen, which induced
the retreat of Joseph from Madrid, Ferdinand was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
again declared king, and the pomp and rejoicings
attendant on this event put an end to all business,
except that of intrigue. The French were everywhere
looked upon by the Spanish as a conquered
foe, and they spent their time in the pageant of
military triumphs and rejoicings, as though the enemy
had already fled. From this dream of fancied security
Palafox was at length awakened by the appearance
of a French corps, which retook Tudela, and
pushed on almost to Saragossa. He appealed to the
governing junta for aid and assistance. Much time
was lost in intrigue and disputes, but at length the
army was organized by appointing La Pena and
Llamas to the charge. To supply the place usually
occupied by the commander-in-chief, a board of
general officers was projected, of which Castanos
should be chief; but when some difficulty arose as
to who the other members should be, this plan was
deferred, with the remark, that &#8220;when the enemy
was driven across the frontier, Castanos would have
leisure to take his seat.&#8221; Of the state of the Spanish
forces at this time, Napier says, &#8220;The idea of a
defeat, the possibility of a failure, had never entered
their minds. The government, evincing neither apprehension,
nor activity, nor foresight, were contented
if the people believed the daily falsehoods
propagated relative to the enemy; and the people
were content to be so deceived. The armies were
neglected, even to nakedness; the soldier&#8217;s constancy
under privations cruelly abused; disunion, cupidity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
incapacity, prevailed in the higher orders; patriotic
ardor was visibly abating among the lower classes;
the rulers were grasping, improvident, and boasting;
the enemy powerful, the people insubordinate. Such
were the allies whom the British found on their
arrival in Spain.&#8221; Sir Arthur Wellesley had returned
to Ireland, and the chief command was now given to
Sir John Moore. This general, with the greatest
celerity, marched his troops to the Spanish frontier,
by the way of Almeida, having overcome almost
insurmountable obstacles, arising from the state of
affairs in Spain. Sir David Baird, with a force of
ten thousand men, landed at Corunna, and also advanced
to the contest; but they soon found that they
were to meet an enemy with whom they were little
able to cope.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ENERGY OF THE FRENCH.</div>

<p>Napoleon, with that energy so often displayed by
him, when the greatness of the occasion required its
exercise, collected, in an incredibly short space of
time, an immense army of two hundred thousand
men, most of them veterans who had partaken of
the glories of Jena, Austerlitz, and Friedland.
These were divided by the emperor into eight parts,
called &#8220;corps d&#8217;armée.&#8221; At the head of each of
them was placed one of his old and tried generals,&mdash;veterans
on whom he could rely. The very names
of Victor, Bessières, Moncey, Lefebre, Mortier,
Ney, St. Cyr, and Junôt, speak volumes for the
character of the army.</p>

<p>These troops were excited to the highest pitch of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
enthusiasm, by the emperor&#8217;s address, as he passed
through Paris, promising that he would head them
in person, to drive the hideous leopard into the sea.
What were the scattered and divided troops of the
Spaniards, to contend with such a force? The grand
French army reached Vittoria almost without an interruption.
Blake was in position at Villarcayo, the
Asturians were close at hand, Romana at Bilboa, and
the Estremadurans at Burgos. With more valor than
discretion, Blake made an attack upon Tornosa.
The enemy pretended to retreat. Blake, flushed
with his apparent success, pursued them with avidity,
when he suddenly came before twenty-five thousand
men, under the Duke of Dantzic, and was
furiously assailed. Blake, after a gallant defence,
was obliged to retreat, in great confusion, upon Bilboa.
He rallied, however, and was again in the field
in a few days, fought a brave action with Villate, and
was this time successful. With the vain-glory of his
nation, he next attacked the strong city of Bilboa.
Here, Marshal Victor gained a signal success, Blake
losing two of his generals, and many of his men.
Romana, who had joined Blake, renewed the action,
with his veterans. They were made prisoners, but
their brave chief escaped to the mountains. Napoleon
himself now left Bayonne, and directed his
course into Spain. Only one day sufficed for his
arrival into Vittoria. At the gates of the city, a
large procession, headed by the civil and military
chiefs, met him, and wished to escort him to a splendid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
house prepared for his reception; but they were
destined to a disappointment. Napoleon was there,
not for pomp or show, but to direct, with his genius,
the march of that army which he had raised. Jumping
from his horse, he entered the first small inn he
observed, and calling for his maps, and a report of
the situation of the armies on both sides, proceeded
to arrange the plan of his campaign. By daylight
the next morning, his forces were in motion. The
hastily levied troops of the Conde de Belvidere, himself
a youth of only twenty years, were opposed to
him. These were routed, with great slaughter,&mdash;one
whole battalion, composed of the students of Salamanca
and Lecon, fell to a man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PASS OF SOMOSIERRA.</div>

<div class="sidenote">NAPOLEON BEFORE MADRID.</div>

<p>The army of the centre, under the command of
Castanos, which was composed of fifty thousand men,
with forty pieces of cannon, was totally routed at
Tudela, by the French, under Lasnes and Ney; and
now but one stronghold remained to the Spaniards,
between the enemy and Madrid. This was the pass
of the Somosierra. Here the Spanish army, under
St. Juan, had posted their force. Sixteen pieces of
artillery, planted in the neck of the pass, swept the
road along the whole ascent, which was exceedingly
steep and favorable for the defence. The Spanish
troops were disposed in lines, one above another;
and when the French came on to the contest, they
warmly returned their fire, and stood their ground.
As yet, the grand battery had not opened its fire.
This was waiting for the approach of the centre, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Napoleon himself. And now Napoleon, seeing that
his troops were not advancing, rode slowly into the
foot of the pass. The lofty mountain towered above
him. Around its top hung a heavy fog, mingled with
the curling smoke that was ascending from the
mouth of all those cannon, rendering every object
indistinct in the distance. Silently he gazed up the
mountain. A sudden thought strikes him. His
practised eye has discerned, in a moment, what
course to pursue. Turning to his brave Polish
lancers, he orders them to charge up the causeway,
and take the battery. They dashed onward.
As they did so, the guns were turned full upon them,
and their front ranks were levelled to the earth; but,
ere they could reload, the Poles, nothing daunted,
sprang over their dying comrades, and before the
thick smoke, which enveloped them as a cloud, had
dispersed, they rushed, sword in hand, upon the soldiers,
and, cutting down the gunners, possessed
themselves of the whole Spanish battery. The panic
became general. The Spaniards fled, leaving arms,
ammunition, and baggage, to the enemy, and the
road open to Madrid. Meanwhile, this city was in
a state of anarchy seldom equalled. A multitude of
peasants had entered the place. The pavements
were taken up, the streets barricaded, and the houses
pierced. They demanded arms and ammunition.
These were supplied them. Then they pretended
that sand had been mixed with the powder furnished.
The Marquis of Perales, an old and worthy gentleman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
was accused of the deed. The mob rushed to
his house. They had no regard for age. They
seized him by his silvery hair, and, dragging him
down the steps, drew him through the streets until
life was extinct. For eight days the mob held possession
of the city. No man was safe; none dared
assume authority, or even offer advice. Murder,
and lust, and rapine, and cruelty, stalked fearlessly
through the streets. On the morning of the ninth,
far away on the hills to the north-west, appeared a
large body of cavalry, like a dark cloud overhanging
the troubled city. At noon, the resistless emperor
sat down before the gates of Madrid, and summoned
the city to surrender. Calmness and quiet reigned
in the French camp, but Madrid was struggling like
a wild beast in the toils. Napoleon had no wish to
destroy the capital of his brother&#8217;s kingdom, but he
was not to be trifled with. At midnight, a second
summons was sent. It was answered by an equivocal
reply, and responded to by the roar of cannon
and the onset of the soldiery. This was an appeal
not to be resisted. Madrid was in no state to stand
a siege. At noon, two officers, in Spanish uniform,
and bearing a flag of truce, were observed approaching
the French headquarters. They came to demand
a suspension of arms, necessary, they said, to persuade
the people to surrender. It was granted, and
they returned to the city, with Napoleon&#8217;s message.
Before six o&#8217;clock in the morning, Madrid must surrender,
or perish. Dissensions arose, but the voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
of prudence prevailed, and the capital yielded. Napoleon
was wise; he had no wish to goad a people
already incensed to fury. The strictest discipline
was maintained, and a soldier of his own guard was
shot for having stolen a watch. Shops were reopened,
public amusements recommenced, and all
was quiet. In six short weeks every Spanish army
was dissipated. From St. Sebastian to the Asturias,
from the Asturias to Talavera, from Talavera to the
gates of Saragossa, all was submission, and beyond
that boundary all was apathy or dread.</p>

<p>An assemblage of the nobles, the clergy, the corporations,
and the tribunals, of Madrid, now waited
on Napoleon at his headquarters, and presented an
address, in which they expressed their desire to have
Joseph return among them. Napoleon&#8217;s reply was
an exposition of what he had done and intended doing
for Spain. Could the people but have yielded their
prejudices, and submitted to his wise plans, what seas
of tears and blood, what degradation and confusion,
might have been spared to poor, unhappy Spain!</p>

<div class="sidenote">ADDRESS TO THE SPANISH PEOPLE.</div>

<p>&#8220;I accept,&#8221; said he, &#8220;the sentiments of the town
of Madrid. I regret the misfortunes that have befallen
it, and I hold it as a particular good fortune,
that I am enabled to spare that city, and save it yet
greater misfortunes. I have hastened to take measures
to tranquillize all classes of citizens, knowing
well that to all people and men uncertainty is intolerable.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have preserved the religious orders, but I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
restrained the number of monks; no sane person
can doubt that they are too numerous. Those who
are truly called to this vocation, by the grace of God,
will remain in the convents; those who have lightly,
or for worldly motives, adopted it, will have their
existence secured among the secular ecclesiastics,
from the surplus of the convents.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have provided for the wants of the most interesting
and useful of the clergy, the parish priests.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have abolished that tribunal against which Europe
and the age alike exclaimed. Priests ought to
guide consciences, but they should not exercise any
exterior or corporal jurisdiction over men.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have taken the satisfaction which was due to
myself and to my nation, and the part of vengeance
is completed. Ten of the principal criminals bend
their heads before her; but for all others there is
absolute and entire pardon.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have suppressed the rights usurped by the
nobles during civil wars, when the kings have been
too often obliged to abandon their own rights, to
purchase tranquillity and the repose of the people.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have suppressed the feudal rights, and every
person can now establish inns, mills, ovens, weirs,
and fisheries, and give good play to their industry,
only observing the laws and customs of the place.
The self-love, the riches, and the prosperity, of a small
number of men, were more hurtful to your agriculture
than the heats of the dog-days.</p>

<p>&#8220;As there is but one God, there should be in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
estate but one justice; wherefore all the particular
jurisdictions have been usurped, and, being contrary
to the national rights, I have destroyed them. I have
also made known to all persons that which each can
have to fear, and that which they may hope for.</p>

<p>&#8220;The English armies I will drive from the Peninsula.
Saragossa, Valencia, Seville, shall be reduced,
either by persuasion or by force of arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no obstacle capable of retarding, for
any length of time, my will; but that which is above
my power is to constitute the Spaniards a nation,
under the orders of a king, if they continue to be
imbued with divisions, and hatred towards France,
such as the English partisans and the enemies of the
continent have instilled into them. I cannot establish
a nation, a king, and Spanish independence, if
that king is not sure of the affection and fidelity of
his subjects.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Bourbons can never reign again in Europe.
The divisions in the royal family were concerted by
the English. It was not either King Charles or his
favorite, but the Duke of Infantado, the instrument
of England, that was upon the point of overturning
the throne. The papers recently found in his house
prove this. It was the preponderance of England
that they wished to establish in Spain. Insensate
project! which would have produced a long war without
end, and caused torrents of blood to be shed.</p>

<p>&#8220;No power influenced by England can exist upon
this continent. If any desire it, their desire is folly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
and sooner or later will ruin them. I shall be obliged
to govern Spain; and it will be easy for me to do it,
by establishing a viceroy in each province. However,
I will not refuse to concede my rights of conquest
to the king, and to establish him in Madrid,
when the thirty thousand citizens assemble in the
churches, and on the holy sacrament take an oath,
not with the mouth alone, but with the heart, and
without any jesuitical restriction, &#8216;to be true to the
king,&mdash;to love and support him.&#8217; Let the priests
from the pulpit and in the confessional, the tradesmen
in their correspondence and in their discourses, inculcate
these sentiments in the people; then I will
relinquish my rights of conquest, and I will place
the king upon the throne, and I will take a pleasure
in showing myself the faithful friend of the Spaniards.</p>

<p>&#8220;The present generation may differ in opinions.
Too many passions have been excited; but your
descendants will bless me, as the regenerator of the
nation. They will mark my sojourn among you as
memorable days, and from those days they will date
the prosperity of Spain. These are my sentiments.
Go, consult your fellow-citizens; choose your part,
but do it frankly, and exhibit only true colors.&#8221;</p>

<p>The ten criminals were the Dukes of Infantado,
of Hijah, of Mediniceli, and Ossuna; Marquis Santa
Cruz, Counts Fernan, Minez, and Altamira; Prince
of Castello Franco, Pedro Cevallos, and the Bishop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
of St. Ander, were proscribed, body and goods, as
traitors to France and Spain.</p>

<p>Napoleon now made dispositions indicating a vast
plan of operations. But, vast as his plan of campaign
appears, it was not beyond the emperor&#8217;s
means; for, without taking into consideration his
own genius, activity and vigor, there were upon
his muster-rolls above three hundred and thirty
thousand men and above sixty thousand horse; two
hundred pieces of field artillery followed his corps to
battle; and as many more remained in reserve. Of
this great army, however, only two hundred and
fifty thousand men and fifty thousand horses were
actually under arms with the different regiments,
while above thirty thousand were detached or in
garrisons, preserving tranquillity in the rear, and
guarding the communications of the active forces.
The remainder were in hospitals. Of the whole host,
two hundred and thirteen thousand were native
Frenchmen, the residue were Poles, Germans and
Italians; thirty-five thousand men and five thousand
horses were available for fresh enterprise, without
taking a single man from the lines of communication.</p>

<p>The fate of the Peninsula hung, at this moment,
evidently upon a thread; and the deliverance of that
country was due to other causes than the courage,
the patriotism, or the constancy, of the Spaniards.
The strength and spirit of Spain was broken; the
enthusiasm was null, except in a few places, in consequence
of the civil wars, and intestinal divisions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
incited by the monks and British hirelings; and the
emperor was, with respect to the Spaniards, perfectly
master of operations. He was in the centre
of the country; he held the capital, the fortresses,
the command of the great lines of communication
between the provinces; and on the wide military
horizon no cloud interrupted his view, save the city
of Saragossa on the one side, and the British army
on the other. &#8220;Sooner or later,&#8221; said the emperor,
and with truth, &#8220;Saragossa must fall.&#8221; The subjugation
of Spain seemed inevitable, when, at this
instant, the Austrian war broke out, and this master-spirit
was suddenly withdrawn. England then put
forth all her vast resources, and the genius and vigor
of Sir John Moore, aided, most fortunately, by the
absence of Napoleon, and the withdrawal of the
strength of his army for the subjugation of the
Peninsula; and it was delivered from the French, after
oceans of blood had been spilt and millions of treasure
wasted, to fall into the hands of the not less tyrannical
and oppressive English. &#8220;But through what
changes of fortune, by what unexpected helps, by
what unlooked-for events,&mdash;under what difficulties, by
whose perseverance, and in despite of whose errors,&mdash;let
posterity judge; for in that judgment,&#8221; says
Napier, &#8220;only will impartiality and justice be
found.&#8221;</p>

<div class="sidenote">BONAPARTE LEAVES SPAIN.</div>

<p>Tidings having reached the emperor that the
Austrian army was about to invade France, he recalled
a large portion of his army, and appointing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
his brother Joseph to be his lieutenant-general, he
allotted separate provinces to each corps d&#8217;armée,
and directing the imperial guard to hasten to France,
he returned to Valladolid, where he received the
addresses of the nobles and deputies of Madrid, and
other great towns; and after three days&#8217; delay, he
departed himself, with scarcely any escort, but with
such astonishing speed as to frustrate the designs
which some Spaniards had, in some way, formed
against his person.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RETREAT OF SIR JOHN MOORE.</div>

<p>The general command of the French army in
Spain was left with Soult, assisted by Ney. This
gallant general, bearing the title of the Duke of
Dalmatia, commenced his pursuit of the English
army with a vigor that marked his eager desire to
finish the campaign in a manner suitable to its brilliant
opening. Sir John Moore had arrived in Salamanca
by the middle of November, and on the 23d
the other divisions of the army had arrived at the
stations assigned them. Sir David Baird had already
reported himself at Astorga, when Moore received
positive information that the French had entered
Valladolid in great force. And this place was only
three days&#8217; march distant from the British. At a
glance, the great mind of Moore comprehended the
full difficulty of his critical situation. In the heart
of a foreign country, unsupported by the Spanish
government, his army wanting the very necessaries
of life, he found himself obliged to commence that
retreat in winter, over mountains covered with snow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
which proved so fatal to the British army, or wait to
meet the French troops, flushed with victory, and
sustained by an overwhelming force. In vain he
appealed to the junta of Salamanca for aid. In vain
he endeavored to arouse the spirit of patriotism,
which had shone forth so brightly in the first days
of the insurrection. Instead of aiding him either to
advance or retreat, they endeavored to direct him
what course to pursue; and painted, with true Spanish
pride and hyperbole, in glowing colors, what their
armies had done, and what they could do. His
camp was therefore struck, and he retreated through
the rocks of Gallicia, closely followed by the pursuing
army. Whenever the advance guards of the
enemy approached, the British rallied with vigor,
and sustained their reputation for bravery; but they
displayed a lamentable want of discipline in all other
parts of their conduct. The weather was tempestuous;
the roads miserable; the commissariat was
utterly defective, and the very idea that they were
retreating was sufficient to crush the spirits of the
soldiery. At Bembibre, although the English well
knew that the French were close behind, they broke
into the immense wine-vaults of that city. All effort
by their officers to control them was utterly useless.
Hundreds became so inebriated as to be unable to
proceed, and Sir John Moore was obliged to proceed
without them. Scarcely had the reserve marched
out of the village, when the French cavalry appeared.
In a moment the road was filled with the miserable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
stragglers, who came crowding after the troops, some
with shrieks of distress and wild gestures, others
with brutal exclamations; while many, overcome
with fear, threw away their arms, and those who
preserved them were too stupidly intoxicated to fire,
and kept reeling to and fro, alike insensible to their
danger and disgrace. The enemy&#8217;s horsemen, perceiving
this, bore at a gallop through the disorderly
mob, cutting to the right and left as they passed,
and riding so close to the columns that the infantry
were forced to halt in order to protect them. At
Villa Franca even greater excesses were committed;
the magazines were plundered, the bakers driven
away from the ovens, the wine-stores forced, the
doors of the houses were broken, and the scandalous
insubordination of the soldiers was, indeed, a disgrace
to the army. Moore endeavored to arrest this disorder,
and caused one man, taken in the act of
plundering a magazine, to be hanged. He also
endeavored to send despatches to Sir David Baird,
directing him to Corunna, instead of Vigo; but his
messenger became drunk and lost his despatches, and
this act cost the lives of more than four hundred
men, besides a vast amount of suffering to the rest
of the army. An unusual number of women and
children had been allowed to accompany the army,
and their sufferings were, indeed, dreadful to witness.
Clark, in his history of the war, gives a heart-rending
account of the horrors of this retreat. &#8220;The
mountains were now covered with snow; there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
neither provision to sustain nature nor shelter from
the rain and snow, nor fuel for fire to keep the vital
heat from total extinction, nor place where the weary
and footsore could rest for a single hour in safety.
The soldiers, barefooted, harassed and weakened by
their excesses, were dropping to the rear by hundreds;
while broken carts, dead animals, and the piteous
appearance of women, with children, struggling or
falling exhausted in the snow, completed the dreadful
picture. It was still attempted to carry forward
some of the sick and wounded;&mdash;the beasts that drew
them failed at every step, and they were left to
perish amid the snows.&#8221; &#8220;I looked around,&#8221; says
an officer, &#8220;when we had hardly gained the highest
point of those slippery precipices, and saw the rear
of the army winding along the narrow road. I saw
their way marked by the wretched people, who lay
on all sides, expiring from fatigue and the severity
of the cold, their bodies reddening in spots the white
surface of the ground. A Portuguese bullock-driver,
who had served the English from the first
day of their arrival, was seen on his knees amid the
snow, dying, in the attitude and act of prayer. He
had, at least, the consolations of religion, in his dying
hour. But the English soldiers gave utterance to far
different feelings, in their last moments. Shame and
anger mingled with their groans and imprecations on
the Spaniards, who had, as they said, betrayed them.
Mothers found their babes sometimes frozen in their
arms, and helpless infants were seen seeking for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
nourishment from the empty breasts of their dead
mothers. One woman was taken in labor upon the
mountain. She lay down at the turning of an angle,
rather more sheltered than the rest of the way
from the icy sleet which drifted along; there she
was found dead, and two babes which she had brought
forth struggling in the snow. A blanket was thrown
over her, to hide her from sight,&mdash;the only burial that
could be afforded; and the infants were given in
charge to a woman who came up in one of the carts,
little likely, as it was, that they could survive such
a journey.&#8221;</p>

<div class="sidenote">DESTRUCTION OF MAGAZINES AT CORUNNA.</div>

<p>Soult hung close on the rear of this unfortunate
army, and pursued them until they reached Corunna,
on the 12th of January. As the morning dawned, the
weary and unfortunate general, saddened by the
dark scenes through which he had passed, sensible
that the soldiers were murmuring at their retreat, unsupported
by his Spanish allies, and well aware that
rumor and envy and misunderstanding would be
busy with his name in his own native land, appeared
on the heights that overhung the town. With eager
and anxious gaze, he turned to the harbor, hoping to
perceive there his fleet, which he had ordered to sail
from Vigo. But the same moody fortune which had
followed him during his whole career pursued him
here. The wintry sun looked down upon the foaming
ocean, and only the vast expanse of water met
his view. The fleet, detained by contrary winds,
was nowhere visible; and once more he was obliged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
to halt with his forces, and take up quarters. The
army was posted on a low ridge, and waited for the
French to come up. The sadness of the scene was
by no means passed. Here, stored in Corunna, was a
large quantity of ammunition, sent over from England,
and for the want of which both the Spanish
and English forces had suffered, and which Spanish
idleness and improvidence had suffered to remain
here for months, unappropriated. This must now be
destroyed, or fall into the possession of the enemy.
Three miles from the town were piled four thousand
barrels of powder on a hill, and a smaller quantity
at some distance from it. On the morning of the
13th, the inferior magazine blew up, with a terrible
noise, and shook the houses in the town; but when
the train reached the great store, there ensued a
crash like the bursting forth of a volcano;&mdash;the earth
trembled for miles, the rocks were torn from their
bases, and the agitated waters rolled the vessels, as
in a storm; a vast column of smoke and dust, shooting
out fiery sparks from its sides, arose perpendicularly
and slowly to a great height, and then a
shower of stones and fragments of all kinds, bursting
out of it with a roaring sound, killed many persons
who remained too near the spot. Stillness, slightly
interrupted by the lashing of the waves on the shore,
succeeded, and then the business of the day went
on. The next scene was a sad one. All the horses
of the army were collected together, and, as it was
impossible to embark them in face of the enemy, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
were ordered to be shot. These poor animals would
otherwise have been distributed among the French
cavalry, or used as draft-horses.</p>

<p>On the 14th, the transports from Vigo arrived.
The dismounted cavalry, the sick and wounded, the
best horses, belonging to the officers, which had been
saved, and fifty-two pieces of artillery, were embarked
during the night, only retaining twelve guns
on shore, ready for action. And now the closing
scene of this sad drama was rapidly approaching,
giving a melancholy but graceful termination to the
campaign.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEATH OF SIR JOHN MOORE.</div>

<p>On the night of the 15th, everything was shipped
that was destined to be removed, excepting the fighting
men. These were intending to embark, as soon
as the darkness should permit them to move without
being perceived, on the night of the 16th; but in
the afternoon the French troops drew up, and offered
battle. This the English general would not refuse,
and the action soon became general. The battle was
advancing, with varied fortune, when Sir John Moore,
who was earnestly watching the result of the battle
in the village of Elvina, received his death-wound.
A spent cannon-ball struck him on his breast. The
shock threw him from his horse, with violence; but
he rose again, in a sitting posture, his countenance
unchanged, and his steadfast eye still fixed on the
regiments before him, and betraying no signs of pain.
In a few moments, when satisfied that his troops were
gaining ground, his countenance brightened, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
suffered himself to be carried to the rear. Then was
seen the dreadful nature of his hurt. The shoulder was
shattered to pieces; the arm was hanging by a piece
of skin; the ribs over the heart were broken and bared
of flesh, and the muscles of the breast torn into long
strips, which were interlaced by their recoil from the
dragging shot. As the soldiers placed him in a blanket,
his sword got entangled, and the hilt entered the
wound. Captain Hardinge, a staff officer, who was
near, attempted to take it off; but the dying man
stopped him, saying, &#8220;It is as well as it is; I had
rather it should go out of the field with me.&#8221; And
in that manner, so becoming to a soldier, he was
borne from the fight by his devoted men, who went
up the hill weeping as they went. The blood flowed
fast, and the torture of his wound was great; yet,
such was the unshaken firmness of his mind, that
those about him judged, from the resolution of his
countenance, that his hurt was not mortal, and said
so to him. He looked steadfastly at the wound for a
few moments, and then said, &#8220;No,&mdash;I feel that to
be impossible.&#8221; Several times he caused his attendants
to turn around, that he might behold the field
of battle; and, when the firing indicated the advance
of the British, he discovered his satisfaction, and permitted
his bearers to proceed. Being brought to his
lodgings, the surgeon examined his wound, but there
was no hope. The pain increased, and he spoke with
great difficulty. Addressing an old friend, he said,
&#8220;You know that I always wished to die this way.&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Again he asked if the enemy were defeated; and
being told that they were, observed, &#8220;It is a great
satisfaction to me that we have beaten the French.&#8221;
Once, when he spoke of his mother, he became agitated.
It was the only time. He inquired after his
friends and officers who had survived the battle,
and did not even now forget to recommend those
whose merit entitled them to promotion. His strength
failed fast; and life was almost extinct, when he
exclaimed, as if in that dying hour the veil of the
future had been lifted, and he had seen the baseness
of his posthumous calumniators, &#8220;I hope the people
of England will be satisfied; I hope my country
will do me justice.&#8221; In a few minutes afterwards
he died, and his corpse, wrapped in a military cloak,
was interred by the officers of his staff, in the citadel
of Corunna. The guns of the enemy paid his funeral
honors, and the valiant Duke of Dalmatia, with a
characteristic nobleness, raised a monument to his
memory. The following is so beautiful and touching
a description of his burial, that we cannot refrain
from quoting it, even though it may be familiar to
most of our readers. It was written by the Rev.
Charles Wolfe, of Dublin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RESULT OF THE BATTLE.</div>

<p>The battle was continued until dark, under great
disadvantages on the part of the French, owing to the
difficulty they experienced in dragging their heavy
cannon on to the heights, and their small amount of
ammunition. The French loss has been estimated at
three thousand, and the British at eight hundred;
but the loss of the French was undoubtedly exaggerated.
The English availed themselves of the
darkness and the confusion among the enemy to
embark their troops; and so complete were the arrangements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
of Sir John Hope, who succeeded to the
command, that it was all effected, without delay or
difficulty, before morning. The wounded were provided
for, and the fleet, although fired upon by the
French, sailed on the 17th for their home in England.</p>

<p>But their trials were not yet closed. It was Sir John
Moore&#8217;s intention to have proceeded to Vigo, that he
might restore order before he sailed for England;
but the fleet went directly home from Corunna, and a
terrible storm scattered it, many ships were wrecked,
and the remainder, driving up the channel, were glad
to put into any port. The soldiers thus thrown on
shore were spread all over the country. Their haggard
appearance, ragged clothing, and dirty accoutrements,
struck a people only used to the daintiness
of parade with surprise. A deadly fever, the result
of anxiety and of the sudden change from fatigue to
the confinement of a ship, filled the hospitals at
every port with officers and soldiers, and the terrible
state of the army was the all-absorbing topic of conversation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> closed the history of this unfortunate army,
let us now return to Spain. Joseph had returned, a
nominal king, to Madrid. More than twenty-six
thousand heads of families had come forward, of their
own accord, and sworn, by the host, that they desired
his presence amongst them. The marshals, under his
directions, were pursuing the conquest of Spain with
vigor. Though Joseph was nominally lieutenant-general,
Soult was in reality at the head of operations.
A modern writer, speaking of these two
commanders, says Soult was crippled in all his movements,
his sound policy neglected, and his best combinations
thwarted, by Joseph. His operations in
Andalusia and Estramadura, and the firmness with
which he resisted the avarice of Joseph, all exhibited
his well-balanced character. In Andalusia he firmly
held his ground, although hedged in with hostile
armies, and surrounded by an insurgent population,
while a wide territory had to be covered with his
troops.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>King Joseph could not comprehend the operations
of such a mind as Soult&#8217;s, and constantly impeded
his success. When, without ruin to his army,
the stubborn marshal could yield to his commands,
he did; but where the king&#8217;s projects would plunge
him into irredeemable errors, he openly and firmly
withstood them. The anger and threats of Joseph
were alike in vain. The inflexible old soldier professed
his willingness to obey, but declared he would
not, with his eyes open, commit a great military
blunder. King Joseph would despatch loud and vehement
complaints to Napoleon, but the emperor
knew too well the ability of Soult to heed them. Had
the latter been on the Spanish throne, the country
would long before have been subdued, and the French
power established.</p>

<p>We shall not enter into detail of all the operations
in Spain. A short account of some of the principal
battles we will give; and, as we have already detailed
the first siege of Saragossa, our readers may
perhaps like to know the final fate of this devoted
city. We quote from Headley&#8217;s description of the
second siege.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SECOND SIEGE OF SARAGOSSA.</div>

<p>&#8220;The siege at Saragossa had been successively
under the command of Moncey and Junôt. The
camp was filled with murmurs and complaints. For
nearly a month they had environed the town in vain.
Assault after assault had been made; and from the
2d of January, when Junôt took the command, till
the arrival of Lannes in the latter part of the month,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
every night had been distinguished by bloody fights;
and yet the city remained unconquered. Lannes
paid no heed to the murmurs and complaints around
him, but immediately, by the promptitude and energy
of his actions, infused courage into the hearts
of the desponding soldiery. The decision he was
always wont to carry into battle was soon visible in
the siege. The soldiers poured to the assault with
firmer purpose, and fought with more resolute courage.
The apathy which had settled down on the
army was dispelled. New life was given to every
movement; and on the 27th, amid the tolling of the
tower-bell, warning the people to the defence, a
grand assault was made, and, after a most sanguinary
conflict, the walls of the town were carried, and
the French soldiers fortified themselves in the convent
at St. Joseph&#8217;s. Unyielding to the last, the
brave Saragossans fought on, and, amid the pealing
of the tocsin, rushed up to the very mouths of the
cannons, and perished by hundreds and by thousands
in the streets of the city. Every house was a fortress,
and around its walls were separate battle-fields,
where deeds of frantic valor were done. Day after
day did these single-handed fights continue, while
famine and pestilence walked the city at noonday,
and slew faster than the swords of the enemy. The
dead lay piled up in every street, and on the thick
heaps of the slain the living mounted, and fought
with the energy of despair for their homes and their
liberty. In the midst of this incessant firing by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
night and by day, and hand to hand fights on the
bodies of the slain, ever and anon a mine would
explode, blowing the living and dead, friend and
foe, together in the air. An awful silence would
succeed for a moment, and then, over the groans of
the dying, would ring again the rallying cry of the
brave inhabitants. The streets ran torrents of blood,
and the stench of putrefied bodies loaded the air.
Thus, for three weeks, did the fight and butchery go
on, within the city walls, till the soldiers grew dispirited
and ready to give up the hope of spoils, if
they could escape the ruin that encompassed them.
Yet theirs was a comfortable lot to that of the besieged.
Shut up in the cellars with the dead,
pinched with famine, while the pestilence rioted
without mercy and without resistance, they heard
around them the incessant bursting of bombs, and
thunder of artillery, and explosions of mines, and
crash of falling houses, till the city shook, night and
day, as within the grasp of an earthquake. Thousands
fell daily, and the town was a mass of ruins.
Yet, unconquered and apparently unconquerable, the
inhabitants struggled on. Out of the dens they had
made for themselves among the ruins, and from the
cellars where there were more dead than living, men
would crawl to fight, who looked more like spectres
than warriors. Women would work the guns, and,
musket in hand, advance fearlessly to the charge;
and hundreds thus fell, fighting for their homes and
their firesides. Amid this scene of devastation,&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>against
this prolonged and almost hopeless struggle
of weeks,&mdash;against the pestilence that had appeared
in his own army, and was mowing down his own
troops,&mdash;and, above all, against the increased murmurs
and now open clamors of the soldiers, declaring
that the siege must be abandoned till reinforcements
could come up,&mdash;Lannes remained unshaken and
untiring. The incessant roar and crash around him,
the fetid air, the exhausting toil, the carnage and
the pestilence, could not change his iron will. He
had decreed that Saragossa&mdash;which had heretofore
baffled every attempt to take it&mdash;should fall. At
length, by a vigorous attempt, he took the convent
of St. Laran, in the suburbs of the town, and planted
his artillery there, which soon levelled the city around
it with the ground. To finish this work of destruction
by one grand blow, he caused six mines to be
run under the main street of the city, each of which
was charged with three thousand pounds of powder.
But before the time appointed for their explosion
arrived, the town capitulated. The historians of this
siege describe the appearance of the city and its
inhabitants, after the surrender, as inconceivably horrible.
With only a single wall between them and
the enemy&#8217;s trenches, they had endured a siege of
nearly two months by forty thousand men, and continued
to resist after famine and pestilence began to
slay faster than the enemy. Thirty thousand cannon-balls
and sixty thousand bombs had fallen in the city,
and fifty-four thousand of the inhabitants had perished.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Six thousand only had fallen in combat, while
forty-eight thousand had been the prey of the pestilence.
After the town had capitulated, but twelve
thousand were found able to bear arms, and they
looked more like spectres issuing from the tomb than
like living warriors.</p>

<p>&#8220;Saragossa was taken; but what a capture! As
Lannes rode through the streets at the head of his
victorious army, he looked only on a heap of ruins,
while six thousand unburied corpses lay in his path.
Sixteen thousand lay sick, while on the living famine
had written more dreadful characters than death
had traced on the fallen. Infants lay on the breasts
of their dead mothers, striving in vain to draw life
from bosoms that would never throb again. Attenuated
forms, with haggard faces and sunken eyes and
cheeks, wandered around among the dead to search
for their friends; corpses, bloated with famine, lay
stretched across the threshold of their dwellings, and
strong-limbed men went staggering over the pavements,
weak from want of food, or struck with the
pestilence. Woe was in every street, and the silence
in the dwellings was more eloquent than the loudest
cries and groans. Death and famine and the pestilence
had been there, in every variety of form and
suffering. But the divine form of Liberty had been
there too, walking amid those mountains of corpses
and ruins of homes, shedding her light through the
subterranean apartments of the wretched, and, with
her cheering voice, animating the thrice-conquered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
yet still unconquered, to another effort, and blessing
the dying as they prayed for their beloved city.
But she was at last compelled to take her departure,
and the bravest city of modern Europe sunk in bondage.
Still her example lives, and shall live to the
end of time, nerving the patriot to strike and suffer
for his home and freedom, and teaching man everywhere
how to die in defending the right. A wreath
of glory surrounds the brow of Saragossa, fadeless as
the memory of her brave defenders. Before their
achievements,&mdash;the moral grandeur of their firm
struggle, and the depth and intensity of their sufferings,&mdash;the
bravery and perseverance of the French
sink into forgetfulness. Yet theirs was no ordinary
task, and it was by no ordinary means that it was
executed.&#8221;</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ENGLISH LAND AT LISBON.</div>

<p>The English had by no means relinquished their
designs upon the Peninsula. The successes of
Napoleon and his victorious army but served to
stimulate their hatred of the French, and spur them
on to further efforts. Another army was accordingly
collected, and placed under the command of Sir
Arthur Wellesley, who landed in Lisbon on the 22d
of April, 1809. The force under his command was
fourteen thousand five hundred infantry, fifteen hundred
cavalry, and twenty-four pieces of artillery.
The passage of the river Dwero was his first contest
with the French. In this he was successful, and his
success opened to him the gates of Oporto. Soon
after occurred the celebrated battle of Talavera.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
King Joseph was himself nominally at the head of
his troops; but Marshal Victor was, in reality, the
leader. Victor and Soult had both laid their plans
before the king, and urged them with all the eloquence
they were capable of. So sure was Victor
of the victory, should his advice be followed, that he
said that, if his plans should fail, all military science
was useless. The event proved, however, that Soult
was correct.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BATTLE OF TALAVERA.</div>

<p>&#8220;The morning dawned beautifully clear, but a
July sun poured down its burning heat, until the soldiers
were glad to seek shelter from its rays in the
quiet shade. Between the camps of the two armies
flowed a little murmuring rivulet, and, as the French
and English met there to slake their thirst, pleasant
words passed between them. Familiar conversation,
the light laugh and the gay jest, were heard on every
side. But, about one o&#8217;clock, the deep rolling of
drums along the French lines announced to the allies
that the hour had come when those who had met to
slake their thirst in those quiet waters were soon to
mingle to quell in blood their thirst for strife. They,
too, prepared for combat; and, when the loud booming
of the guns gave the signal that the battle was
commenced, eighty cannon opened their destructive
fire, and the light troops went sweeping onward
with the rapidity of a thunder-cloud over the heavens,
while the deep, dark columns marched sternly after,
and charged, with terrible strength, the English lines.
Then all along their fronts the deep-mouthed guns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
opened their well-directed fire, and the infantry
responded to the furious attack with their rapid
volleys, as they closed around the head of the advancing
columns, enveloping them in one sheet of flame,
that streamed like billows along their sides. It was
too much for human courage to endure; and, after
bravely breasting the storm, they were obliged to fall
back in disorder.</p>

<p>&#8220;After various successes and reverses, the French
seemed about to gain the day. The English centre was
broken, and Victor&#8217;s columns marching triumphantly
through it. Just at this juncture, when the English
were scattering on every side, Colonel Donellan,
anxious to save the honor of his army, was seen
advancing through the disordered masses, at the head
of the 48th regiment. The retiring masses on every
side pressed hard against these brave soldiers, and it
seemed, at first, as though they must be carried away
by them; but, wheeling back by companies, they
opened to let the fugitives pass, and then, pursuing
their proud and beautiful line, they marched straight
upon the pursuing columns on the right side, and
poured their rapid fire into the dense ranks. Closing
on the foe with steadiness and firmness, these few
soldiers arrested the progress of the entire mass.
Then their artillery opened its fire upon them, and
the cavalry rallied, and rode round to charge their
flanks; and, after a short and earnest warfare, the
tide of success turned, and victory, which seemed a
moment before in the hands of the French, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
wrested from their grasp, amid the loud shouts and
earnest cheerings of the British. Their troops retired
in good order to their former position, and at six
o&#8217;clock the battle had closed. And now, as both
parties were preparing to remove their wounded, and
pay the last sad duties to the dead, one of those terrible
events occurred which sometimes come to shock
the human soul, and overrun a cup of misery already
full. Hardly had the last troops withdrawn from the
scene of contest, when the long dry grass took fire,
and one broad flame swept furiously over the field,
wrapping the dead and wounded together in its fiery
mantle. The shrieks of the scorched and writhing
victims, that struggled up through the thick folds of
smoke that rolled darkly over them, were far more
appalling than the uproar of battle, and carried consternation
to every heart that heard. Two thousand
men were killed on both sides, and eight thousand
wounded.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ENGLISH RETIRE INTO PORTUGAL.</div>

<p>Soon after, the army effected a junction with Soult,
and Sir Arthur Wellesley was obliged to retreat.
He obtained, however, a promise from the Spanish
general that the English wounded should be removed
from the hospitals of Talavera to some other place.
But this promise, like too many others, was shamefully
violated; and he left the place, abandoning
them all to the mercy of the enemy. When Victor
entered the town, he found the public square covered
with the sick and maimed of both armies, scattered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>around on the pavement, without any one to care for
them. He immediately sent his soldiers into the
houses, commanding the inhabitants to receive the
wounded sufferers. He ordered that one English
and one French soldier should be lodged together,&mdash;thus
softening the asperities of war, and setting an
example to his foes which they would have done
well to follow. If the Spanish had refused to care
for the sick and wounded of their allies, they showed
scarcely more consideration for the men on whose
success their own safety depended. They refused to
supply them with provisions. The soldiers were
weakened by hunger, and the sick dying for want of
necessary succor. Half a pound of wheat in the grain,
and, twice a week, a few ounces of flour, with a quarter
of a pound of goat&#8217;s flesh, formed the sole subsistence
of men and officers. The goats were caught
and killed by the troops; and it was so difficult to
procure even these, that the mere offal of a goat
would bring three or four dollars. Sir Arthur&#8217;s warm
remonstrances to the Spanish junta were answered
only by promises. The soldiers were murmuring at
their bad treatment; and, when pestilence broke out
in the army, and five thousand men died in their
hospitals, Wellesley, deeming it useless to struggle
longer against the force of circumstances, judged it
best again to evacuate Spain, and withdraw his troops
into Portugal. However lightly the English had, in
anticipation, regarded the bravery of the French
troops, experience&mdash;that stern and truthful monitor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>&mdash;had
taught them that they were an enemy not to be
despised, and that Soult, their chief commander, was
as skilful, and, as a tactician, fully equal to Wellington.
Many English writers, in speaking of Wellington,
have drawn a parallel between him and Napoleon,
because he was commander-in-chief when the battle
of Waterloo was won. Yet this long struggle between
the English general and Soult, in Spain, in which he
was as often defeated as conqueror, shows conclusively
that the French and English commanders were
well matched,&mdash;that there was little to choose
between them; and who would think, even for a
moment, of instituting a comparison of equality between
Napoleon and Soult?</p>

<p>We cannot follow the Spaniards, in all their operations,
after the English forces had been withdrawn;
marked, as they often were, by want of courage, and
oftener by want of skill and foresight in their arrangements.
The Partida warfare was now instituted, and
many of the French troops were cut off in this way;
yet the system was a decided injury to Spain. The
heroic defence of Saragossa, already recorded, and
the almost equally courageous one of Gerona, rise as
bright spots on the dark page of Spanish history, and
are well worthy of a name and place in this history.
Most of the siege of Gerona we shall take the liberty
to extract from Tucker&#8217;s Life of Wellington.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SIEGE OF GERONA.</div>

<p>Gerona is a city of Catalonia, situate on the little
river Onar. It is protected by four forts, upon the
high ground above it. Its principal defence, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
was the citadel, called the Monjuie. This is a
square fort, two hundred and forty yards in length
on each side, with four bastions. The garrisons consisted
of three thousand four hundred men, commanded
by Mariano Alvarez,&mdash;a man at once noble,
brave, and humane. Alvarez, who knew that he
could place small dependence on reinforcements from
without, gave every encouragement to the feelings
of the citizens to defend their town to the last extremity.
For this purpose, he formed them into
eight companies of one hundred men each. Nor was
the enthusiasm of the defence shared alone by the
men. Maids and matrons also enrolled themselves
in an association, which they termed the Company
of St. Barbara, to perform whatever lay in their
power. Alvarez knew full well the power which
superstition would exert on the minds of the bigoted
Spaniards. He, therefore, invested St. Narcis, the
patron saint of the Geronans, with the insignia of
generalissimo of all their forces, by land and by sea.
This was done on the Sabbath; and the shrine of the
saint was opened, and a general&#8217;s staff, a sword and
richly-ornamented belt, were deposited with his holy
relics. Such was the joy and excitement of the
Spaniards, that one of their writers says, &#8220;It seemed
as if the glory of the Lord had descended and filled
the church, manifesting that their devotion was approved
and blessed by heaven.&#8221;</p>

<p>A proclamation was also issued by Alvarez, forbidding
all persons, of whatever rank, from speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
of capitulation, on pain of immediate death. This
was received, both by the garrison and people, with
acclamation.</p>

<p>The city was closely invested by eighteen thousand
French, under the command of General Verdier,
on the 6th of May, on the heights of Casa Roca,
where they erected a battery of eleven mortars, and
began to form their first line of circumvallation. The
garrison was too weak to make a sally, or otherwise
prevent them. A flag of truce was sent, with the
conditions on which the French would leave the city;
but the only reply it drew forth was, that the Geronans
would hold no communication with the French,
but at the cannon&#8217;s mouth. At one o&#8217;clock on the
morning of June 14th, the bombardment commenced.
As soon as the first shell struck, the loud tones of the
<i>generale</i> resounded through the streets, and every one
flew to his post. The female Company of St. Barbara,
so far from shrinking from danger, sought
everywhere those spots where most was anticipated.
What bravery or daring could do was done; yet two
castles were yielded up, after a brave but vain resistance.
Palamas was also carried by assault. Very
few of the garrison escaped, and those only by throwing
themselves into the sea. In July, three batteries
kept up an incessant fire upon three sides of the
Monjuie. By one of these discharges the angle on
which the Spanish flag was planted was cut off, and
the flag prostrated into the ditch below. In an instant,
a man was lowered down from the walls to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
regain it. Balls fell like hail around him; yet,
apparently unmindful of the dangers to which he
was exposed, he calmly descended, and, having
recovered the prostrate banner, returned to his comrades
unhurt, and again hoisted it on the walls.</p>

<p>A breach was now made in the walls so wide that
forty men might enter abreast. The works progressed
with more rapidity, as the fire of the besieged
had entirely ceased. It was not that Gerona was
conquered, but, finding that their ammunition was
growing short, they prudently reserved it until the
nearer approach of the enemy should make it more
efficient. On the morning of the 8th, about three
o&#8217;clock, the French, under cover of a most tremendous
bombardment, again assaulted the city. Six
thousand men marched up to the breach, and endeavored
to rush through; but, concealed there in the
ruins of the ravelin, lay a mortar, which discharged
five hundred musket-balls every shot. As they
advanced, it was turned upon them, and their way
was soon impeded by the slain. Three times during
that day the assault was repeated, with the utmost
resolution, by the assailants; and three times were
they obliged to retire before the heroic defenders of
Gerona, leaving sixteen hundred men lifeless on the
field of battle. But the effect of that dreadful
attack was severely felt by the besieged. The tower
of St. Juan had been blown up, and only twenty-three
of its brave little garrison remained alive.</p>

<p>An instance of extraordinary heroism, in a youthful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
drummer, which occurred during the assault, deserves
to be recorded. His name was Luciana Ancio,
and he belonged to the artillery. He was stationed
to give the alarm, when a shell was thrown. A ball
struck his leg off to the knee, and felled him to the
ground. Some women, who saw him fall, hastened
to remove him to a place of greater safety; but he
refused, saying, &#8220;No, no! my arms are left, and I
can still beat the drum to give my comrades warning
in time to save themselves.&#8221; Heaven seemed
to smile upon his bravery; for he alone, of all those
who suffered an amputation of the thigh during the
siege, recovered.</p>

<p>The Company of St. Barbara were everywhere to
be seen, covered with dust and blood, under the
burning heat of a July sun. Those courageous
women, through an incessant fire of the batteries and
the musketry, carried water and wine to the soldiers,
and bore back the wounded. Every day produced
acts of heroism equally conspicuous, for the attack
continued with unabated force. The sharp-shooters
of the enemy were stationed thickly in the trenches;
and so fatal was their aim, that for any of the garrison
to be seen, only for a moment, was certain
death. And, although the sentinels were changed
every half-hour, nine were killed, in one day, at one
post; and, after this, it was only possible to observe
what the enemy were about, by some one in the force
lifting up his head, and taking a momentary glance.</p>

<p>Early in August, the besiegers had pushed their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
parallels to the very edge of the fosse; but here their
efforts were delayed, because the nature of the soil
obliged them to bring earth from some distance to
finish their works. About this time, Castellar de la
Silva, at the head of fifteen hundred men, attempted
to throw supplies into the city; but no precautions
could escape the watchful eye of the besiegers. The
convoy was seized, and only five hundred men, of the
fifteen hundred who defended it, lived to tell the
tale.</p>

<p>The main attacks of the besiegers were now
directed against the ravelin, which had become the
chief defence of Monjuie. Attempts were made,
night after night, to storm it; but in vain. It was
mined, but, as the breastwork was wholly of earth,
the explosion did no injury. A battery was planted
against it, and a sally was made by the besieged,
hoping to destroy it. This attack was headed by a
priest. He was fired upon, and fell. One of the
French officers, at the risk of his own life, protected
him from further injury. But his humanity cost him
his life. One of the Spaniards, mistaking his object,
cut him down. The guns of the battery were
spiked; but this brave attack was of little use,
for the French were well supplied with artillery, and
fresh guns were soon mounted, and played upon the
gate and ravelin.</p>

<p>For thirty-seven days had this fierce conflict been
sustained. The numbers of the besieged were greatly
reduced; the hospitals were filled to overflowing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and pestilence, with all its horrors, spread unchecked,
on every side. Yet this was not all. Grim, gaunt
famine was among them, and began to be severely
felt. Of all their stores, only some wheat and a
little flour remained. Still, there was no thought of
capitulation, although every day diminished their
little stock. On the 19th of September, another
general assault was made, and as bravely met. &#8220;Frequently,&#8221;
says Southey, &#8220;such was the press of conflict,
and such the passion that inspired them, that,
impatient of the time required for reloading their
muskets, the defendants caught up stones from the
breach, and hurled upon their enemies these readier
weapons.&#8221; Four times the assault was repeated in
the course of two hours, and at every point the enemy
was beaten off. The noble Alvarez, during the
whole assault, hastened from post to post, wherever
he was most needed, providing everything, directing
all, and encouraging all. Eight hundred of the besiegers
fell, on this memorable day. A glorious success
had been gained, yet it brought with it no rest,&mdash;no
respite,&mdash;scarcely a prolongation of hope.
There was no wine to cheer the wearied soldiery,
when they returned from the assault&mdash;not even
bread. A scanty mess of pulse, or corn, with a little
oil, or morsel of bacon, in its stead, was all that could
be served out; and even this was the gift of families,
who shared with the soldiers their little stores.
&#8220;What matters it?&#8221; was the answer of these heroes
to the lament of the inhabitants that they had nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
better to give; &#8220;if the food fail, the joy of having
saved Gerona will give us strength to go on.&#8221; Every
day, every hour, added to the distress of the besieged.
Their flour was exhausted, and, for want of other animal
food, mules and horses were slaughtered, and sent
to the shambles. A list was made of all within the
city, and they were taken by lot. Fuel became exceedingly
scarce; yet such was the patriotism of the
people, that the heaps placed at the corners of the
streets, to illuminate them in case of danger, remained
untouched. A glimmering of hope still
remained that the city might be supplied with provisions
by the army of Blake; but even this faint
hope was cut off when Marshal Augereau superseded
St. Cyr in the control of the siege,&mdash;for his first act
was to take possession of Haslatrich, at which place
Blake had stored the greater part of his magazines.
Augereau sent letters to the city threatening an increase
of horrors in case the siege was prolonged,
and offering them an armistice of a month, with provisions
for that time, if Alvarez would then capitulate;
but these terms were rejected with scorn.
Hitherto, the few animals which had remained had
been led out to feed near the burying-ground; but
this was no longer possible, and the wretched animals
gnawed the hair from each other&#8217;s bodies. The stores
of the citizens were now exhausted, and the food for
the hospitals was sometimes seized on the way, by
the famishing populace. Provisions were prepared in
the French camp, and held out to the garrison as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
temptation to desert; and yet, during the whole
siege, only ten so deserted.</p>

<p>At length, human nature could endure no more.
The chief surgeon presented to Alvarez a report on
the state of the city. It was, indeed, a fearful one.
It stated that &#8220;not a single house remained in a habitable
state&#8221; in Gerona. The people slept in cellars, and
vaults, and holes, amid the ruins; and the wounded
were often killed in the hospital by the enemy&#8217;s fire.
The streets were broken up, so that the rain-water and
sewers had stagnated, and their pestilential breath
was rendered more noxious by the dead bodies which
lay perishing in the ruins. The incessant thunder of
artillery had affected the atmosphere, and vegetation
had stopped. The fruit withered on the trees, and
nothing would grow. Within the last three days,
says the report, five hundred of the garrison alone
have died in the hospitals, and the pestilence is still
raging unchecked. &#8220;If, by these sacrifices,&#8221; say its
authors, in conclusion, &#8220;deserving forever to be the
admiration of history,&mdash;and if, by consummating them
with the lives of us, who, by the will of Providence,
have survived our comrades,&mdash;the liberty of our country
can be secured, happy shall we be, in the bosom
of eternity, and in the memory of all good men, and
happy will be our children among their fellow-countrymen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alvarez himself could do no more. Yet would he
not yield to the enemy; but, being seized with a delirious
fever, his successor in command yielded the city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
on honorable terms, on the 10th of December, the
siege having lasted seven months. Alvarez died
soon after, and the central junta awarded honors and
titles to his family, and exempted the whole city
from taxation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ENGLISH AT TORRES VEDRAS.</div>

<p>The surrender of this devoted city closed the campaign
for 1809. The principal events of the campaign
of 1810 were the battle of Busaco, in which
the English gained the victory, and the retreat of the
French Marshal Massena. For four months and a
half, Massena had continually followed the retreating
forces of Wellington, until now he had retired beyond
the lines of Torres Vedras. The English had been
engaged on these lines a year, until they had at last
rendered them almost impregnable. They consisted
of three lines of intrenchments, one within another,
extending for nearly thirty miles. On these lines
were a hundred and fifty redoubts, and six hundred
mounted cannon. Here Massena saw his enemy
retire within these lines, and he then knew that his
utmost efforts to dislodge him must prove abortive.
Besides, Wellington here received reinforcements to
his army, which increased it to one hundred and
thirty thousand men.</p>

<p>Besides these defences, there were twenty British
ships of the line, and a hundred transports, ready to
receive the army, if forced to retire. Unwilling to
retreat, Massena sat down with his army here, hoping
to draw Wellington to an open battle. But he preferred
waiting for an attack upon his intrenchments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
or to starve the enemy into a retreat. This he knew
must soon be done. Wellington himself declares
that Massena provisioned his sixty thousand men and
twenty thousand horses, for two months, where he
could not have maintained a single division of English
soldiers. But his army was now reduced to
starvation; and he, driven to the last extremity, saw
that he must either commence his retreat at once, or
his famine-stricken army would be too weak to march.
Arranging his troops into a compact mass, he placed
the rear guard under the command of Ney, and retired
from the Torres Vedras. Wellington immediately
commenced the pursuit; but, owing to the
skilful arrangements of the French marshal, he
found it impossible to attack him with success.
Taking advantage of every favorable position, he
would make a stand, and wait until the main body of
the army had passed on, and then would himself fall
back. Thus, for more than four months, did this
retreat continue, until he arrived at the confines
of Portugal, having lost more than one-third of
his army. Many were the cruelties practised on
this retreat. They have often been described, and
form a dark spot on the English historian&#8217;s page.
All war is necessarily cruel; and the desolation and
barrenness that followed in the track of the French
army, wasting the inhabitants by famine, were a powerful
check on Wellington in his pursuit. The track
of a retreating and starving army must always be
covered with woe; and one might as well complain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
of the cruelty of a besieging force, because innocent
women and children die by hunger.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ESCAPE OF FRENCH PRISONERS.</div>

<p>The siege of Cadiz occupied the spring and summer
of this year. During this siege, a tremendous
tempest ravaged the Spanish coast, lasting four days.
By it more than forty sail of merchantmen, besides
three line-of-battle ships, were driven on shore. It
was during this tempest that the French and Swiss
on board the prison-ships in the harbor made their
escape. &#8220;The storm was so great,&#8221; writes one of
the unhappy captives, &#8220;that we could not receive
our supply of provision from the shore. Our signals
of distress were wholly disregarded by the Spanish
authorities; and, had it not been for the humanity
of the British admiral, who sent his boats to their
relief, many more of our miserable men must have
perished.&#8221; The pontoons in which these prisoners
were confined were not properly secured; and the
prisoners on board the Castilla, seeing that the wind
and tide were in their favor, cut the cable, and, hoisting
a sail which they had made from their hammocks,
steered for the opposite coast. They were seven
hundred in number, and most of them officers. English
boats were sent against them, but they found the
French were prepared. The ballast of the vessel in
which they were confined was cannon-balls of twenty-four
and thirty-six pounds&#8217; weight. These the French
hurled by hand into the boats of their pursuers, and
soon disabled them, so that the fugitives finally succeeded
in escaping with but little loss.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>The first two months of the year 1811 were most
inauspicious for the Spanish cause. General Suchet
possessed himself of Tortosa, and on the 23d of the
same month Soult became master of Olivenza. On
the same day died the Marquis de la Romana, one of
the most skilful and noblest of the Spanish leaders;
and he had scarcely expired, before his army met
with a signal defeat at Gebora.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> given to my readers some slight sketches
of the rise and progress of this war previous to the
time when I first became an active participator in its
scenes, I shall now continue it, with the history of
my own adventures.</p>

<p>In looking back through the long series of years
that have elapsed since those eventful days, there are
few scenes that I can recall more vividly than that
which occurred on the morning I left Gibraltar. It
was my first experience of the kind, and, therefore,
made a deeper impression than many after scenes,
which might have been far more worthy of record
than this. It was a beautiful morning, and everywhere
the troops were in motion. Horses were
brought out, our baggage prepared and sent on; the
light jest and laugh and joke went freely round, serving,
in many instances, to conceal the thoughts that
longed for utterance. Farewells were exchanged,
last words spoken; and, finally, all were prepared,
the word given, and our gallant little army marched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
out of Gibraltar. It was truly a brilliant sight; and
the lively strains of our music contributed its share
to make us forget that we were marching into a
country at all times perilous, and now doubly so, to
meet certain dangers, and, many of us, certain death.
Yet these were in the future, and lost beneath the
crowd of bright and joyous anticipations that kindled
in our hearts as the last loud cheering of our comrades
died away, and the walls of the far-famed city
receded in the distance behind our onward march.
Our course was directed to Tarifa; here we had
orders to wait until the forces from Cadiz should
come up. An expedition had been sent out from
this city, consisting of ten thousand men, three thousand
of whom were British, whose object was to drive
the French general out of his lines. Victor, having
heard of this project, enlarged and strengthened his
own forces, which now amounted to about twenty
thousand men, in Andalusia.</p>

<p>The allied army sailed from Cadiz on the 20th of
February, for Tarifa; but, a storm arising soon after
they left, they were driven past this port, and disembarked
at Algesiras. They marched to Tarifa on the
23d, under the command of General Thomas Graham.
Here we met; and, as we were more recently from
home than these troops, we had many questions to
answer, and much information both to give and
receive. Before night, however, we had all our
places assigned to us, and were now ready for our
march. But the Spanish General La Pena had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
yet arrived; and so we remained encamped here until
the 27th, when he came up, with his forces; and to
him General Graham, for the sake of unanimity, ceded
the chief command. All day we were busy in preparations
for our morrow&#8217;s march, expecting at its
close to come within a short distance of the enemy&#8217;s
outposts. Early the next morning, our whole army
was in motion. We moved forward about twelve
miles, over the mountain ridges that descend from
Ronda to the sea; and then, having learned that the
enemy were only four leagues distance, we halted,
for the purpose of reorganizing the army. The command
of the vanguard was given to Lardizabal, that
of the centre to the Prince of Anglona, while General
Graham had charge of the reserve, consisting of two
Spanish regiments and the British troops. The cavalry
of both nations, formed in one body, was commanded
by Colonel Whittingham. The French army
were encamped near Chiclana, narrowly observing
the movements of the allied armies, and determined,
at all events, to hold complete possession of the
country.</p>

<p>The next day, March 2d, the vanguard of our
army stormed Casa Viejas. Having gained this small
place, and stationed here a regiment, we continued
our march on the 3d and 4th.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ALLIED ARMY.</div>

<p>Early in the morning of the 5th, as the advanced
guards of our cavalry had proceeded a short distance
from the main army, they suddenly came upon a
squadron of French troops. Unfortunately for them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
several stone fences and enclosures prevented an
immediate attack, so that the French had time to
form into a square, and received their charge with
great coolness and intrepidity. Their square was
unbroken, although numbers had fallen on both sides.
A second charge was equally unsuccessful, and the
colonel of our cavalry was mortally wounded. Our
men then judged it most prudent to fall back upon
the main army, and no attempt was made to follow
them by the enemy. An anxious look-out was instituted,
but the foe did not again make his appearance,
and at nine o&#8217;clock the same morning our commander
took up his position on the heights of Barossa.</p>

<p>The hill of Barossa is a low ridge, creeping in from
the coast about a mile and a half, and overlooking a
high broken plain. On one side of this plain rise the
huge coast cliffs, while the other is skirted by the
deep forest of Chiclana. Directly in front, there lies
a light pine wood, beyond which rises a long narrow
height, called the Bermeja. There were two ways
by which this might be reached; the first was through
the woods, while the second was a narrow road
directly under the coast cliffs.</p>

<p>I have already alluded to the fact, that, although
the English and Spanish were fighting under the
same banner, there was a great want of unanimity of
feeling and opinion as to the course which ought to
be pursued in ridding their country of their common
foe. Nowhere, in the history of the war, was this
more apparent than at the battle whose history I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
about to relate. The deep-seated pride of the Spanish
made them unwilling to acknowledge or yield to
the superiority of the British, or hardly to allow that
they were at all indebted to them. A modern traveller
tells us that, in a recent history of this war,
which was, not long since, published in Spain, the
British are not even mentioned, nor the fact of their
assistance at all alluded to. It was impossible for
two nations so unlike in their customs and manners,
so different in language, religion, and education, to
be so closely associated together as they were obliged
to be, without occasions of dispute constantly occurring,
which would, probably, have terminated in open
rupture, had not the discipline of war prevented.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DISSENSIONS.</div>

<p>The fact that our gallant general had ceded the
chief command to the weak and imperious Spanish
commander had occasioned no little dissatisfaction
among our men; while, from the conditions required
of him by Graham, we may judge that that general
himself did not pursue this course because he judged
La Pena his superior in military tactics. These
conditions were, that his army should make short
marches; that they should be kept fresh for battle,
and that they should never approach the enemy
except in concentrated masses. Although the Spanish
general had pledged his word of honor that
these conditions should be fulfilled, how much attention
he paid to them may be judged from the fact,
that, on the day but one preceding this, we had
marched fifteen hours, through bad roads; and, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
a short rest, had occupied the whole night in our
march to Barossa. Before the troops had all arrived,
or had any time for rest or refreshment, La Pena
commanded the vanguard to march against San Petri,
which lay about four miles distant. A detachment
of the Spanish army, under Zayas, had, only two days
before, commenced an intrenchment at this point;
but had been surprised by the French, and driven
back, so that the enemy now held possession of all
the outposts down to the sea. But a short time had
elapsed, after the departure of the vanguard, when
we were startled by the roar of the artillery, whose
rapid discharge, together with the quick volleys of
musketry, showed us that a sharp engagement had
already taken place. Lardizabal,&mdash;far more worthy
of command than his superior,&mdash;notwithstanding the
unfavorable situation in which he found himself
placed, succeeded in forcing his way through the
enemy&#8217;s troops, leaving three hundred men dead on
the field of battle, and in effecting a junction with
Zayas. Graham now endeavored to persuade La
Pena to occupy the heights of Barossa, as a superior
position to the Bermeja. The Spanish general not
only refused to listen to his representations, but sent
an immediate order to General Graham to march
through the wood to Bermeja with all the British
troops. This order he obeyed, although it was in
opposition to his own better judgment, leaving only
two detachments at Barossa, under Major Brown, to
guard the baggage. He would have left a stronger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
force, had he not supposed that La Pena would remain
in his present position, with his own troops, and
would thus assist those detachments, in case of an
attack. But scarcely had the British entered the
wood, when La Pena, without the least notice to his
colleague, with his whole army, took the sea road
under the cliffs, and marched to San Petri, leaving
Barossa crowded with baggage, within sight of the
enemy, and guarded only by four guns and five
battalions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">VICTOR&#8217;S ATTACK.</div>

<p>No sooner did Victor, the French general, observe
its defenceless state, than he advanced with a rapid
pace, and, ascending behind the hill, drove off the
guard, and took possession of the whole stores and
provisions of our army. Major Brown, finding his
force wholly inadequate to face the enemy, slowly
withdrew, having immediately despatched an aid-de-camp
to inform General Graham of the attack. Our
army had then nearly reached the Bermeja; but, as
soon as the messenger arrived with the news, our
general saw at once the necessity of taking the
direction of affairs himself. Orders were immediately
given to retrace our steps as rapidly as possible, that
we might assist the Spanish army in its defence.
Judge, then, of the astonishment of our general, on
reaching the plain, at the view that presented itself!
One side of the heights was occupied by the French,
while the Spanish rear-guard was flying, with their
baggage, in great confusion, on the other. On one
side of us lay the cavalry of the French, and, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
other marching to the attack was a large body of
troops, under Laval. &#8220;Where is La Pena?&#8221; was the
first exclamation of our commander, as, casting his
eye rapidly around, he could nowhere see the least
trace of him. It was impossible that he could have
been defeated. The cannonade would have been
heard, or at least some fugitives have taken the
direction of our army. Slowly the conviction forced
itself upon his mind that he had been deserted. A
general burst of indignation ran along our lines; but
short time was allowed for feelings like these. Only
one alternative existed,&mdash;a hasty retreat, or an
immediate attack. It need hardly be said that
Graham chose the latter.</p>

<p>Ten guns immediately opened their fire upon
Laval&#8217;s troops, and were promptly answered back by
the artillery of the French. No time was given to
the British to form with any attention to regiments;
but, hastily dividing themselves into two masses, they
rushed to the attack. The charge on the left was,
indeed, a furious one, for we felt that conquest or
death was the alternative. It was bravely met,
however, on the part of the French. After the first
discharge of artillery, the soldiers pressed rapidly
onward, and were soon mingled with the foe in fierce
and deadly conflict. The front ranks of the French
were pressed back upon the second line, which, unable
to withstand the shock, was broken in the same
manner, and scattered in much confusion, only the
chosen battalion remaining to cover the retreat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">BATTLE OF BAROSSA.</div>

<p>Ruffin, who commanded the enemy on the right,
had stationed his troops just within the wood, where
they awaited, in perfect order, the division under
Brown, who rushed with headlong haste to the contest.
When they had nearly reached the wood, they
discharged their musketry. Nearly half of Brown&#8217;s
detachment fell at the first fire; yet, nothing daunted,
the remainder maintained their ground, until another
detachment came to their aid. Then, mingling close
in the dreadful combat, they pressed together to the
brow of the hill, without either party gaining a
decided advantage. Here the contest continued,
with more bravery than before. The issue still remained
quite doubtful, when the British, retiring a
short distance, again rushed to the attack. Ruffin
and Rousseau, the French leaders, both fell, mortally
wounded, and the French were obliged to retire,
leaving three of their guns in possession of their
enemies. Discomfited but not disheartened, they
withdrew again, re-formed, and rushed to the attack.
But they found no slumbering foe. Our guns were
well manned. Their fire was reserved until the
enemy were close at hand, and then they were
allowed to tell upon that living mass. The execution
was terrible. Closely and rapidly, discharge
followed discharge. Again and again were they
summoned to the attack; but the lines had hardly
closed over their dying comrades, when another
volley would again send confusion and death among
the advancing ranks. Victor saw it was useless to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
struggle longer. The trumpet sounded, the contest
stopped, and in less than an hour the English were
again undisputed masters of Barossa.</p>

<p>And where, during this conflict, were the Spanish
troops, in whose cause the British were so freely lavishing,
not only treasure, but their own lives?
Scarcely three miles away, the report of every round
of musketry reached La Pena&#8217;s ears. He knew that
his ally was placed under great disadvantages; yet
he could look idly on, not knowing, scarcely caring,
apparently, how the contest should be decided. In
vain did many of his brave troops mount their
chargers, and wait only for the word of command to
rush upon the enemy. He listened neither to the
voice of honor nor to the entreaties of his officers,
nor to the ill-repressed murmurings of the soldiery.
No stroke in aid of the British was struck by a
Spanish sabre that day; although one or two
regiments, unable longer to contain their indignation,
left without orders, and came up in season to witness
the defeat of the French. And thus terminated the
attack on Barossa. Scarcely two hours had passed
from the first alarm before the French were retreating
beyond our reach, for our troops were too much
exhausted by their twenty-two hours&#8217; march, and
their still longer fast, to think of pursuing. Yet,
short as the conflict was, the terrible evidences of its
fatality lay all around us. Fifty officers, sixty
sergeants, and more than eleven hundred British
soldiers, had fallen, while two thousand of the enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
were either killed or wounded. Six guns, an eagle,
two generals mortally wounded, and four hundred
prisoners, fell into the power of the English. La
Pena&#8217;s conduct during this battle was complained of
by our commander, and the Spanish cortes went
through the forms of arresting him; but he was soon
after released, without investigation, and published
what he called his justification, in which he blamed
Graham severely for his disobedience of orders.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FIELD OF VICTORY.</div>

<p>When the last of the enemy had disappeared in
the distance, the troops were all summoned to the
field of battle. We collected there, and gazed
around with saddened hearts. Four hours ago, and
there was not one, of all that now lay lifeless on that
bloody field, whose heart did not beat as high as our
own, whose hopes were not as brilliant; and yet,
their sun had now set forever! I know of no sadder
scene than a field of battle presents soon after the
conflict, even though the glorious result may have
filled our hearts with joy. When the roll is called,
and name after name uttered without response, it
cannot but awaken the deepest sensibility in the
heart of the survivors. And then the hasty burial
of the dead, and the hurried sending off the
wounded, the surgeon&#8217;s necessary operations, and the
groans of the sufferers, all make us feel that these
are the horrors of war. Before the battle is the
rapid marching and counter-marching, and the enlivening
strains of martial music, the encouraging
words of the officers,&mdash;more than all, the excitement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
which must exist in such a scene,&mdash;and all these serve
to elevate and sustain the spirits. During the contest
the excitement increases, until all sense of fear
and danger is lost. But one thing is seen&mdash;the foe;&mdash;but
one object exists&mdash;to conquer. When all
these have passed away, and there is no longer aught
to excite, then the eye opens on stern and dread
reality, and we realize what we have escaped, and
the pain and suffering ever attendant on such scenes.
There is something awfully trying to the soul, when
the last sad rites are being performed for those so
lately buoyant in life and health,&mdash;especially when
we meet with the corpses of those we have known
and loved. I have seen many affecting instances of
such recognitions. Among others that I might
name, is that of a French captain of dragoons, who
came over after the battle with a trumpet, and
requested permission to search among the dead for
his colonel. His regiment was a fine one, with
bright brass helmets and black horse-hair, bearing
a strong resemblance to the costume of the ancient
Romans. Many of our own soldiers accompanied
him in his melancholy search. It was long before
we found the French colonel, for he was lying on his
face, his naked body weltering in blood. As soon
as he was turned over, the captain recognized him.
He uttered a sort of agonizing scream, sprang off his
horse, dashed his helmet on the ground, knelt by the
body, and, taking the bloody hand in his own, kissed
it many times, in an agony of grief. He seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
entirely to forget, in his sorrow, that any one was
present. We afterwards learned that the colonel
had, in his youth, done him a great service, by releasing
him from the police when evil company had led
him to the commission of some crime. It was his
first act of the kind; and gratitude to the colonel led
to an immediate enlistment in his corps. From that
hour he had been to the captain as a father, and it
was through his influence that he had attained his
present rank in the army. The scene was truly an
affecting one; and it was with feelings of deep
sympathy that we assisted him in committing the
body to the earth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">REJOICINGS OVER THE VICTORY.</div>

<p>Our gallant commander remained on the field of
battle all that day; and when all the last sad duties
were performed, and as many of the commissariat
mules as could be found were gathered in, we marched
from the scene of our late victory, and took up our
position behind the Isla. The news of our victory
was received in England with much joy, and our own
regiment, the 28th, was spoken of with peculiar
honor. These contests in Spain called forth much
newspaper praise, and awakened the lyre of many
a poet in the halls of old England. Perhaps the following
lines from Southey, written on this battle,
may be acceptable to the reader:</p>

</div></div>

<div class="sidenote">GREAT PRIVATION.</div>

<p>The brilliant success gained on the heights of Barossa
was but the prelude of other victories. The
star of Napoleon, so long in the ascendant, had begun
to decline in the horizon. Obliged to draw off many
of his troops, those that remained felt the want of his
guiding hand. Division reigned in the councils of
his generals; and the British leader, ever ready to
take advantage, and ever on the watch for opportunity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
saw his favorable moment, and followed it up.
The French had retreated from Portugal, followed at
every step by the army of the English. After the
battle of Barossa, Graham had withdrawn from the
command of our army, and joined that of Wellington,
while Sir Thomas Picton took his place. We remained
for a number of days near our position, while
these changes were taking place, and then orders
arrived that we should proceed at once to the mountains
of the Sierra Morena, to assist in harassing the
retreat of the French. We had scarcely commenced
our march when our provisions began to fail, owing
to the conduct of the Portuguese government, who
would not supply their troops with provisions; and
so they were unable to continue the pursuit, while
numbers were perishing for want of food. Our generals
could not see their allies suffering thus, and our
own supplies were shared with them, and we were all
put upon short allowance. Half a pound of bread,
and half a pound of salt pork, was all that we received
for a day&#8217;s provision. And we were ascending
mountains covered with woods and deep forests, infested
by guerillas, who often fell upon and murdered
our men, if they strayed away from the ranks. To
prevent this was impossible; for, if there were provisions
in the country, men in our starving condition
would not fail to obtain them; but scarcely anything
could be found, at this season. The French army
were also suffering for want of food, and, as they
preceded us in their retreat, they either devoured or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
destroyed everything that could sustain life. The
poor peasants on their route fled from their homes,
and shrunk equally from French and English, for
they well knew that either would equally deprive
them of the little they possessed. The sufferings of
the peasantry were truly terrible. In the third day
of our march, a scene occurred which I shall never
forget. We were slowly toiling up a huge mountain,
so exhausted, from fatigue and want, that we could
hardly proceed. When about half-way to the summit,
we perceived before us a large house. Some
of our men hastened to it at once, hoping to procure
some provision. The slight fastenings of the door
soon yielded to their eager haste, and they were
about to rush in, when their steps were arrested by
the misery the scene presented. The floor was covered
with persons in a state of actual starvation.
Thirty women and children had already expired;
and, scattered around among the corpses, lay fifteen
or sixteen more wretched beings, still breathing, but
unable to speak. Hungry as we were, the hearts of
the soldiers were moved at the scene, and our next
day&#8217;s provision was cheerfully contributed to rescue
them from death. But this kindness could only delay
their fate. They were too weak to seek for more
food; they had scarcely strength to eat the little we
could offer them; and it is more than probable that
every one perished.</p>

<p>The next day my comrade, who had been fast failing,
declared himself unable to proceed. He was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
fine fellow,&mdash;one that I had known in Ireland, and to
whom I was much attached. Feeble as we were, we
could not leave him behind, and we carried him a
short distance; but he soon died. Permission was
given us to carry him a little way from the camp
to bury him. We hollowed out a shallow grave,
wrapped him in his blanket, and left him to his fate.
Near the spot where we interred him was a small
house, which we entered, and were fortunate enough
to obtain a little wine. While in the house, we heard
a scream, as of fear. We hastened out, and saw
several of our soldiers running swiftly towards the
camp, from the place where we had interred our
comrade. They had dug him up, for the purpose of
robbing him of his blanket. As they were ripping
it open, the knife entered the flesh, and he began to
struggle. It was this that had so frightened them.
We went to the poor fellow, finished removing his
blanket, and found that he was still alive. Want
and fatigue had produced a state of insensibility
resembling death, from which he had been aroused
by the pain of his wound. We shared with him the
little wine we had obtained, which so revived him
that he was able to accompany us back from his own
funeral. He soon after recovered, and returned home
to Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SINGULAR INCIDENT.</div>

<div class="sidenote">EFFORTS TO OBTAIN FOOD.</div>

<p>A day or two after this occurrence, I left the
company, with one of my companions, and went
higher up the mountain, in search of wild pigs, which
are sometimes found there. This was absolutely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
against our orders; but, as we were literally starving
to death, the consequences of disobedience, and the
dangers of our journey, weighed but little in the balance.
I agreed to search one side of the mountain,
while he ascended the other, and we were to meet
at the top. When about half-way up the mountain,
I was stopped by a ball whizzing close past my ear.
Thinking that it might be my comrade, who did not
see me, I turned, and, looking around, soon saw the
green feather of my assailant, projecting over a rock.
At this I was somewhat alarmed; for he was so completely
hid behind the rock that I could not fire at
him, and I knew that he was reloading his musket.
In a moment more he fired again, but, fortunately for
me, his musket flashed in the pan. There was still
only his feather in sight; at this I fired, and struck
it. I then reloaded as hastily as possible, and advanced
cautiously up the mountain, hoping to get
sight of him. As I was coming round the point of
the rock, he sprang forward, laid down his gun,
spread out his arms, and exposed himself to my shot.
I knew, by his motions, that he had no ammunition,
and as I had no desire to kill him, I fixed my bayonet
on my gun, as if I would make a charge, and
then advanced towards him, in a friendly manner.
But, when I was within twice the length of my gun
from him, he picked up his musket and attacked me.
Darting back to avoid his bayonet, I fired my own
gun, and he fell to the ground. I examined his
knapsack, and found that it bore the mark of the 95th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
rifle brigade of our own division. He was a guerilla,
and had doubtless killed the man whose knapsack he
bore. I examined his canteen, and found, to my
great surprise, a pint of Jamaica brandy. In my
exhausted state, this was a discovery which gave me
the greatest pleasure. I took some of it, and, feeling
quite refreshed, pursued my search for game.
I had not gone far before I discovered a small pig,
which I succeeded in shooting. This I carried with
me to the top of the mountain, where I found my
comrade awaiting me. He had been less successful
than myself, having found nothing. He asked me
how I had fared. I told him that I had shot an old
hog and a little pig, at which he expressed great
pleasure. I then showed him the contents of the
canteen, which he joyfully shared with me; and,
having related my adventure, we retraced our steps
to the camp. We concealed our treasure as well as
we were able; but, notwithstanding all our care, the
first person we saw, on our return, was the adjutant.
He came up to us, and demanded where we had
been. Upon the mountain, in search of food, was
my reply. He told me, if he should report us, as he
was required to do, we should be shot for disobeying
orders. I answered, that it made little difference with
us; it would only hasten affairs, as it was impossible
to survive much longer without food. &#8220;Did you
find any?&#8221; he asked. We showed him our prize.
He would gladly have purchased it of us; but food,
in our condition, was far more precious than money,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
and we refused his offer of a doubloon, with the
assurance that five would be no temptation to part
with it. But, on arrival at our quarters, as we were
cutting up the pig, gratitude for his kindness, in not
reporting us, so far overcame our selfishness, that we
sent him a quarter of it. The remainder made our
mess a fine meal; and we certainly were never in a
better condition to estimate the value of food than
when we devoured the little pig of the Morena.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GUERILLAS.</div>

<p>I have alluded to the annoyance by guerillas, or,
as they were sometimes called, Partidas. These were
principally, at first, Spanish peasants, who, unable to
present any efficient force against the French, and
unwilling to submit to them, threw themselves into
the mountains, and, being well acquainted with all
the passes and hiding-places, did the French much
damage, by cutting off their communications, robbing
their stores, and murdering every one who dared to
stray from the main army. As the war proceeded,
their numbers were enlarged by all those who were
weary of the restraints of law;&mdash;every robber that
feared a jail, or could break from one; every smuggler
whose trade had been interrupted,&mdash;and there
were thousands of these, as there still are, in Spain;
every one who was weary of the restraints of his
life, and sought for excitement; and all idlers
who preferred the wild and reckless daring of these
troops to the drill and watch of the army, were found
either as associate or chief in these bands. They
soon became regularly organized, chose their chiefs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
and had watchwords, by which they could obtain a
safe pass all over the country. They were professedly
our allies, but they were almost as much a terror
to us as to our foes. They proved, however,
invaluable to our army, as a means of communication
with each other, and as spies on the movements of
our enemies. It was impossible for the French to
communicate with each other at all, except by sending
strong escorts, and these were often cut off;
while, on our side, news could be sent with almost
the rapidity of telegraph, and this undoubtedly was
a great advantage to us. The chiefs of these bands
were often obliged to procure subsistence and treasure
for themselves, by robbing their own countrymen;
and, indeed, one of the principal causes of the
sudden growth of these bands was the hope of intercepting
the public and private plate, which was
being carried from all parts of Spain to be coined
into money. Yet, though most of the bands were
worthless characters, there were some among them
of more noble spirit. Some were actuated by revenge&mdash;some
by a gallant, enterprising spirit&mdash;and
a few by an honest ambition to serve their country.</p>

<p>Our troops often met with many adventures with
these foes; and many were the weary hours, in our
toilsome marches, that were beguiled by the recital
of their hair-breadth escapes, or their own wonderful
adventures. Some of these were of so much interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
that I cannot refrain from a desire to recount a
few to my readers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A GUERILLA&#8217;S VENGEANCE.</div>

<p>Don Julian Sanchez was the son of a farmer, on
the banks of the Guebra. The little cottage where
he resided, with his parents and one sister, was the
abode of happiness and plenty. In an evil hour, the
French army passed that way. Their cattle were
driven away and slaughtered, and their little harvest,
just reaped, became the prey of the plunderers.
Terrified and despairing, Julian fled, with his parents
and sister, to the woods. But his parents were old,
and, before they could reach the shelter of the wood,
they were overtaken, carried back to the cottage, and
murdered, in cold blood, on their own hearthstone.
Julian and his sister concealed themselves in a cave;
but the next day he left her there, and went to see
if he could obtain any trace of his parents. Directing
his course to their little cottage, he found their
murdered corpses. Revenge and anger, in a spirit
like Julian&#8217;s, was deep, not loud. He shed no tear,
uttered no complaint,&mdash;but calmly proceeded to
inter the bodies of his parents in a humble grave.
Then, kneeling on the sod, he swore revenge on their
murderers,&mdash;a revenge which should be followed till
his latest breath. He returned to his sister; but, as
he approached the cave where he had left her, what
a sight met his view! A party of the hated army
were just issuing from its precincts. The body of
his beautiful sister lay on the ground naked,&mdash;dishonored,&mdash;the
victim of a vile outrage. Julian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
gazed for a moment on the scene. He had no time
for tears, and he had sworn to live for revenge,&mdash;a
vow which now burned itself in deeper characters
upon his soul. He turned away. A huge rock overhung
the cave. He ascended it, and, secreting himself
in a little fissure where he could be heard, not
seen, he gazed for a few moments on the chief of
the band, till every line of his countenance was impressed
on his soul. Then, calling to him from the
rock, he said, &#8220;You hear me, but you see me not. I
am a Spaniard, the son of those parents you murdered
yesterday&mdash;the brother of her whose corpse
lies before you. You are their murderer; and I swear,
by the Holy Virgin, that I will never lose sight for
one day of your path, until my hands are imbrued in
your heart&#8217;s best blood! You may think to escape
me; but remember, you shall die by my hand!&#8221;</p>

<p>In a moment, the troops of the French were on the
rock. They searched everywhere for the speaker,
but no trace of him could be found, until, just as they
had relinquished their search, one of the number fell
dead by the blow of an unseen assassin. He was
the first of the band that fell. Months passed away.
Julian had never since met his foe; but the frequent
death of his followers, and the daring exploits of
robbery that were constantly performing in his camp,
often called to mind the voice he had heard. A few
months after, in battle, this officer was attacked, and
would have been killed, had not a Spaniard saved his
life, at the risk of his own. He turned to thank his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
unknown deliverer, but was met with so fierce a
look of hate, that he involuntarily shrunk from it.
&#8220;I desire no thanks,&#8221; said the Spaniard; &#8220;your
life is mine, and none but me shall take it.&#8221; The
voice was recognized, but its owner had glided away
in the confusion. A year had elapsed, when this
officer was again sent to the banks of the Guebra,
and took up his quarters in the very house Julian&#8217;s
father formerly occupied. The first night of his stop
there was enlivened by the arrival of four of the
same party who had met with him the year before.
In joyous mood, they had seated themselves around
the table, and were discussing the events of the campaign.
Suddenly they were startled by a deep voice,
which the officer had cause to remember, and Julian,
with four of his associates, glided into the room. So
sudden, so unexpected, was the attack, that they had
not time to grasp their swords, ere they were pinioned
and led away. Julian and the chief alone
remained. &#8220;Look at me,&#8221; said Julian; &#8220;do you
know me? In this very room, a year ago, my parents
fell by your murderous hand. The stain of their
blood still remains to witness against you. In that
wood lies the corpse of my idolized and only sister.
You were her assassin. You heard my vow. Not
for one day have I left your steps. Twice have I
warded death from your head; but when I saw you
desecrate again this hearthstone by your accursed
presence, I knew that your time had come. Frenchman,
prepare to die!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>After the death of this man, Julian succeeded in
organizing a regular band. At the head of these,
he would again and again assault the enemy, even
though they outnumbered his own band many
times. Another instance of his daring intrepidity,
at a time when we were suffering for want of provisions,
and of the patience with which he followed
up his designs, deserves to be recorded. It was the
custom of the French garrison to send out their cattle
beyond the walls every morning, for the purpose of
grazing, under the protection of a guard, which at
once kept them from wandering too far, and also
watched the movements of the Spanish army. Don
Julian determined, if possible, to surprise the herd.
For this purpose, he concealed himself, with his band,
day after day, among the broken ground, near the
river. But the guard was still too powerful and vigilant
to allow him to make the attempt. At length,
as if to reward him for his patience, fortune threw
in his way, not only the object for which he sought,
but one of far more importance to him. On a certain
day, the governor of the place where the garrison
was stationed came out, accompanied by a very
slender escort, and ventured imprudently to cross
the river, at the self-same spot where Julian lay concealed.
He was instantly surrounded, and made
prisoner. Almost at the same moment, the cattle,
frightened by the explosion of a shell which fell
among them, ran towards the river. The guard followed,
but overtook them at such a distance from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
city, that Julian thought himself justified in making
the attack. It was attended with perfect success,
and governor and cattle were conveyed in triumph
to the British headquarters.</p>

<p>Another of these chiefs was named Juan Martin
Diaz, or the &#8220;Empecinado.&#8221; When the news of the
detention of Ferdinand at Bayonne first reached
Spain, he was engaged as a farmer. Young, ardent,
and daring, he threw aside his plough, and persuaded
a neighboring youth, only sixteen, to join him. Their
first object was to procure horses and arms. They
took post upon the high road from France to Madrid,
for the purpose of intercepting the French couriers.
An occasion soon occurred. A party of six men
were riding past a narrow defile. An old woman
went out and arrested the progress of the last two,
by offering them some fruit for sale. She detained
them until the others were in advance some distance;
then the two youths fired from their covert, and their
victims fell. Long before the others returned for
their comrades, their horses and arms were far away.
These boys were soon joined by others, of which
Juan was the chief; and, as he grew older and had
more experience, his band increased, until it numbered
one thousand five hundred men. With these
he performed the most daring exploits, cutting off
supplies, and intercepting convoys. By his intelligence,
activity, and bravery, he was enabled to do
the enemy much mischief. In vain were armies sent
to surround his band. They concealed themselves in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
their fastnesses, and baffled them all, until his very
name became a terror to the French armies. He
gave no quarter to the conquered; and such was his
discipline of his followers, and his generosity in the
division of the spoils, that he became the idol of
his band, and they were willing to undertake any
exploit at his bidding.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DARING EXPLOIT OF JUAN MARTIN DIAZ.</div>

<p>A convoy was conveying, in a carriage, a lady, a
relative of Marshal Moncey. The coach was escorted
by twelve soldiers, in the centre of two columns of
six thousand each, about a mile asunder. The Empecinado,
with only eight of his followers, was concealed
close to the town of Caraveas. He allowed
the leading column to pass, then boldly rushed upon
the convoy, put to death the whole of the escort,
seized and carried off the carriage; and, when the
alarm was given, Martin and his prize were in safety
in the mountains, where he effectually eluded the
search made after him. He saved the life of the
lady, who was sent to his own house, and had every
attention paid her. This convoy was a very rich
prize of money and jewels. This he divided among
his men, reserving only a small share for himself.
He often met with very narrow escapes. On one
occasion, he was unhorsed and disarmed, and the
sword of his opponent passed through his arm, and
entered his side. His wound seemed to give him
new courage. He suddenly sprang at his foe, and,
seizing him by the neck, dragged him to the ground.
He fell with him, however, but continued to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
uppermost. The other refusing to surrender, the
Empecinado held him fast with one hand, while with
the other he snatched up a stone, and beat him to
death. On another occasion, he was nearly made
prisoner by some Spanish troops in the pay of the
French; and, finding every other hope of escape
impossible, he threw himself down an immense precipice,
rather than fall into their hands. His fall
was broken by the projecting limbs of trees, covered
with very thick foliage. He was discovered here by
one of his followers, and taken home. He recovered
finally, after suffering a severe illness, which for some
time prevented his taking the field.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EXPLOITS OF XAVIER MINA.</div>

<p>The most distinguished of these courageous leaders
was Xavier Mina. He was a student at Pamplona
when the revolution broke out. His father was
a considerable land-owner, and deputy for one of the
valleys of Navarre. Some act of injustice, practised
towards his father, had driven young Xavier
to desperation. His resolution was taken. He
threw aside his studies, went to his native village,
and, summoning around him the young men of his
acquaintance, related his wrongs, and urged them to
join him in his career of revenge. Moved by his
enthusiastic address, twelve of his companions volunteered
to join him. Arming themselves with muskets
and ammunition, they sought the mountain
passes, and maintained themselves, while awaiting
opportunities of action, by subsisting on the sheep
belonging to Mina&#8217;s father. His first adventure was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
to surprise a party of seven artillery-men, who were
carrying two pieces of cannon and a quantity of ammunition
from Saragossa to Pamplona. When the
news of this success reached his village, others were
encouraged to volunteer. His next exploit was, with
his band of twenty, to attack a general officer, who
was escorted by twenty-four foot and twelve horsemen.
Stationing his men in a narrow defile, he gave
orders to fire as they were descending, each one having
selected his man. Twenty of the escort were
thus levelled to the earth, before they had any
intimation of their danger. The general was one of
the number. The rest of the escort were made prisoners,
and a large sum of money fell into Mina&#8217;s
hands. This he distributed among his men, advising
them to send part to their families, and retain no
more than would suffice for the expenses of their own
interment, exposed as they now continually were to
death. The men were thus raised in their own
estimation, and in that of their countrymen, wherever
this was told; and volunteers soon presented themselves
in abundance, attracted by a success which
was reported everywhere with the usual exaggerations.
He received, however, only such persons as
he regarded as a valuable acquisition to his band.
These wore a red ribbon in their hats, and a red collar
to their jackets. In Arragon, a band of fifty robbers
were adding to the miseries of that unhappy
country. Having heard of their atrocities, Mina
turned his course thither. He succeeded in surprising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
them. The greater part were killed on the spot,
and the remainder sent as prisoners to Tarragona.
Rations were voluntarily raised for his people, wherever
they were expected, and given as freely at one
time as they were paid for at another by the spoils
of the enemy. It was in vain that the French made
repeated efforts to crush this enterprising enemy. If
his band were dispersed, it was only to unite, and,
by striking a blow in some weak point, render themselves
more formidable than before.</p>

<p>A large number of prisoners, and an amount of
treasure, were to be sent from Vittoria to France.
Twelve hundred men accompanied it as an escort.
At the Puerto de Arlaban, they were attacked by
the seemingly omnipresent Mina, of whose absence,
in another part of the country, they thought themselves
assured. They were entirely routed; but,
unfortunately, two hundred of the prisoners were
slain in the contest. Information of the journey of
this escort had been procured from a new recruit in
Mina&#8217;s band, who had his own object to accomplish
by it. He was a gentleman of some standing, who
was engaged to a beautiful Spanish lady. Her affections
had been stolen from him by a wounded French
officer, quartered in her father&#8217;s house. He had
recovered, and was now taking his bride home to
France. The former lover had sworn a deep revenge,
and, unable himself to accomplish this object, had
enlisted the powerful Mina on his side. When the
band returned to their haunts, they carried with them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
six ladies, who were guilty of the same crime, viz.,
having accepted, as husbands, French officers.
Their fate was, indeed, a sad one. The contest for
them had been fierce in the extreme. They had
seen their protectors, one by one, fall around them,
fighting until the last breath in their defence; and
now they were left helpless to the mercy of their
conquerors. A mock trial was instituted. They
were found guilty of aiding the enemies of their
country, and all of them executed.</p>

<p>But Mina was not always successful. Not long
after this, he had attacked and overcome a party of
French. As he was conveying his prisoners to
Robres, he was betrayed by one of his own men, and
was attacked as suddenly as he had fallen upon
others. His band were scattered, many of them
slain, and he escaped, with great difficulty, with his
own life. One week afterward, he appeared in the
Rioja, with five thousand men, and attacked a Polish
regiment, which was retiring to France. They were
entirely routed. Mina enlarged his band by an
accession of every one of the Spanish prisoners
whom he had liberated, and filled his coffers with the
booty. One million of francs fell into his hands,
besides the equipages, arms and stores of all kinds,
and a quantity of church plate. Two weeks after, he
captured another convoy, going from Valencia to
France. General Abbé now bent his whole force to
disperse his troops. For three days in succession he
followed Mina&#8217;s troops to their haunts, and each day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
defeated them; so that, on the last day, Mina was
obliged again to flee alone for his life. Yet, not discouraged,
he struggled on with various success, until
at length he fell into the hands of the French, who
sent him a prisoner to France. Great rejoicings
were made when the capture of this formidable
enemy was reported; but they soon found that they
had little reason for joy, for his place at the head
of the band was taken by his uncle, Francisco, who
proved himself, if possible, even more formidable than
his nephew. His various adventures would well
fill a volume, and it is easy to see the interest they
must have possessed when related around the bivouac
fire on those mountains, where no one knew but that
any moment might bring his army around them.</p>

<p>But to return to my own history. We were still
pursuing our weary course, sometimes coming within
sight of our enemies, and sometimes marching and
counter-marching, when our leaders thought best to
avoid a battle. We were still suffering the pangs of
hunger, our principal food being a supply of ground
bark. The soldiers continued to wander away, and
often escaped, with their lives, from imminent peril.
One of our men observed, at a little distance from the
camp, a commotion in the bushes, which he thought
was occasioned by some wild animal; and he hastened
out to secure it. Creeping cautiously along under
the bushes, his course was suddenly arrested by a
bullet flying over him. Having passed around a rock
which concealed him from the camp, he hastily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
jumped up, and looked round. He soon spied a
woman sitting near a small spring, with a child in
her arms, as he thought; but, concluding that it was
best to be on his guard, he crept cautiously near her,
and soon saw that she was thoroughly armed, and
what seemed to be a child was something which
certainly did not possess life. The shot had
evidently been fired by her, and she was watching
for his reäppearance. He fired, and killed her. On
taking her arms, he discovered that it was one of the
guerillas, dressed in female apparel, and evidently
intended for a decoy. Judging from articles found
around him, all our troops had not been so successful
as was our soldier in discovering the disguise.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ADVENTURES IN SEARCH OF FOOD.</div>

<p>There are not many villages on these mountains,
and but few scattered habitations. The next day
after the adventure I have just related, a small party
of us again left in search of food. We soon found, in
a beautiful valley, a small house. We knocked for
admission. There was no answer; so, without further
ceremony, the door was broken down, and we
entered. A fire was found burning on the hearth,
showing, however desolate the hut might now be, it
had not long wanted inhabitants. We found, however,
no food, and were turning away, quite disappointed,
when one of our number spied an open
hole in the garden. We found there, to our great
delight, two pigs of wine, which our near approach
had probably disturbed its owners in their attempts to
conceal. These pig-skins were to us quite a curiosity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
The skin is taken as entire as possible from
the animal, and turned so that the hair will be inside,
and then preserved in such a way as to make
it capable of holding wine. These are the common
wine-casks of the country. I have often seen loads
of them; and so perfectly do they retain their resemblance;
that any one unaccustomed to the sight
would say, at once, that they were loads of dead
porkers. We took our wine, and returned as rapidly
as possible to the lines, to share our good fortune
with our comrades.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEPARTURE FOR BADAJOS.</div>

<p>A day or two after this, as we were encamped on
one of the hills which overlooked the country to a
great distance, a movement on the plains below
attracted the attention of our officers. Scouts were
instantly sent out, to learn the nature of it. Animation
again appeared in the faces of our men; for,
even if it were the enemy, we all felt it would be
far better to win an honorable death in an open battle,
than to perish daily, as we were doing, by
hunger and murder. It was not long before our
messengers returned, spurring their horses, and joy
in every feature of their countenances. As soon as
they came within hearing, they flung up their caps
in the air, shouting, &#8220;Relief, relief! our commissariat
is coming! It will soon be here!&#8221; The excitement
among our men was intense. They could
hardly be restrained from rushing down immediately
to break upon the long-expected, long-delayed supplies.
When, at length, they came near, and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
saw the baggage-wagons, accompanied by a strong
escort, the ill-repressed enthusiasm of the men
burst forth in one long, deafening shout, that reverberated
from the tops of those mountains for miles
around. The scene then presented by our camp
was, indeed, an exciting one. Officers were engaged
on all sides in distributing provisions to the starving
troops, and these in administering cordials and
refreshments to their sick comrades. Many of the
sick, who were apparently near their end, revived and
soon recovered. The same escort brought information
that the destination of Wellington&#8217;s army was
now to be changed, and our division of it was
directed to proceed immediately to Badajos. This,
too, was joyful news; and, with the morrow&#8217;s dawn,
everything was ready for motion. Tents were struck,
our baggage stored, and order everywhere restored.
Once more we had an aim, an object; and, with this,
it was easy to become again docile and obedient. I
shall never forget the sensation of pleasure that
throbbed in our hearts, as our last column defiled
down the mountain, and we bade farewell to those
haunts, which had been so nearly fatal to us all.
Our course was immediately directed to Badajos,
and, on the 3d of May, we sat down three leagues
from its walls.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BADAJOS.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Badajos,</span> the capital of the Spanish province of
Estremadura, is situated near the Portuguese frontier,
at the confluence of the small stream of the
Rivillas with the Guadiana. It is very strongly
fortified, both nature and art having contributed
their stores to render its position impregnable. A
huge rock, one hundred feet high, overlooks the
meeting of the waters. On the top of this rock rises
an old castle, venerable from its age, and itself a
strong fortification. The town occupies a triangular
space between the rivers, and is protected by eight
curtains and bastions, from twenty-three to thirty
feet high, with good counterscarps, covered way and
glacis. On the left bank of the Guadiana there is
a lunette, covering a dam and sluice, which commands
an inundation. Beyond the Rivillas stands
an isolated redoubt, called the Picurina. This is
four hundred yards from the town. Two hundred
yards from the ramparts, rises a defective crown-work,
called the Pardaleras. On the right bank of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
the Guadiana rises a hill, crowned by a regular fort,
three hundred feet square, called San Christoval.
A bridge, supported by twenty-two stone arches,
crosses the stream, and this is protected by a bridge
head. The strength of this place made its possession
a desirable object to both parties. It had been
early invested by the French, under Soult, and
vigorously assaulted. It was, however, well defended,
and would probably have maintained its
position, had it not been for the weakness and inefficiency
of its commanding officers, which caused
the battle of the Gebora to terminate in a shameful
defeat and immense loss to the Spanish army.
Rafael Menacho was next made commander of the
place. He sustained the siege with great spirit, and
everything seemed to promise favorably, when
Menacho was unfortunately killed, during a sally,
and the command devolved upon Imas, a man most
unfitted for this situation. He surrendered, almost
without a struggle, to the French; although he had
received certain information that a strong army was
moving to his assistance, and would soon raise the
siege. He demanded that his grenadiers should
march out of the breach. Permission was granted,
but they were obliged themselves to enlarge it,
before they could do so. The French immediately
took possession of the city, and strengthened its defences.
Lord Wellington was much chagrined at
the loss of this place, and early in May sent Lord
William Stewart to invest it. The siege was carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
on with vigor, but under great disadvantages, arising
from want of the proper materials for construction
of the works. In endeavoring to erect their
batteries, the engineers were obliged to labor exposed
to a heavy fire from the city, which proved so
destructive, that, before one small battery against one
of the outworks of the town was completed, seven
hundred men and five officers had fallen. When, at
length, on the morning of the 11th of May, this battery
was completed, before night five of its guns
were silenced by the enemy, and the rest were so
exposed that it was impossible to man them. The
same day news reached our army that the French
army were coming to the relief of Badajos. Immediately
our commander took steps to raise the siege,
as to remain there would have exposed our whole
force to destruction. On the night of the 13th,
he removed all his artillery and platforms; and
on that of the 14th, his guns and stores. But so
secretly was this done, that the French were entirely
ignorant of it, until, as the rear guard were about
being drawn off, they made a sally, and, of course,
discovered it. Soon after this, the battle of Albuera
occurred.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ASSAULT UPON FORT CHRISTOVAL.</div>

<p>Our own division was not, however, engaged in this
battle, having been ordered to Campo Mayor, where,
on the 24th, orders reached us that we were again to
march for Badajos, Lord Wellington having resolved
to invest it in person. We immediately marched,
and arrived on the evening of the 27th, where we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
found Lord Wellington, with ten thousand men.
During the absence of our army, Phillipon, the
governor of the place, had entirely destroyed the
little remains of fortifications left by them, repaired
all his own damages, and procured a fresh
supply of wine and vegetables from the country.
He had also mounted more guns, and interested the
towns-people on his side. The works of the siege
were commenced under Wellington&#8217;s own direction,
on the 29th, and carried on a week, with various
success. Then it was resolved to make an assault
upon Fort Christoval. The storming party, preceded
by a forlorn hope, and led by Major McIntosh, with
the engineer Forster as a guide, reached the glacis
and descended to the ditch about midnight, on the
night of the sixth of June. The French had, however,
cleared all the rubbish away, so that seven feet
perpendicular still remained; and above this were
many obstacles, such as carts chained together,
pointed beams of wood, and large shells ranged along
the ramparts, to roll down upon the assailants. The
forlorn hope, finding that the breach was still impracticable,
was retiring, with little loss, when they
met the main body, leaping into the ditch with ladders,
and the ascent was again attempted; but the
ladders were too short, and the confusion and mischief
occasioned by the bursting of the shells was so great
that the assailants again retired, with the loss of more
than one hundred men. Two nights after, a second
attack was made, but met with no better success.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
The British troops, with loud shouts, jumped into the
ditch. The French defied them to come on, and at
the same time rolled barrels of powder and shells
down, while the musketry made fearful and rapid
havoc. In a little time, the two leading columns
united at the main breach; the supports also came
up; confusion arose about the ladders, of which only
a few could be reared; and the enemy, standing on
the ramparts, bayoneted the foremost assailants, overturned
the ladders, and again poured their destructive
fire upon the crowd below. One hundred and
forty men had already fallen, and yet not a single
foot had been gained, nor was there one bright spot
in the darkness to encourage them to proceed. The
order was given to retire. The next day, Wellington
heard that the army of Soult was again advancing
to attack him; and as to receive battle there would
throw all the disadvantage on his side, he thought
best to raise the siege. On the 10th, the stores
were all removed, and the siege turned to a blockade,
which was afterwards terminated, when the
armies of Marmont and Soult, having effected a
junction, advanced to its relief. It was nearly a
year before the allied army again found it desirable
to approach Badajos. Meanwhile the war was carried
on with great activity, although with varied
success.</p>

<p>My own time was passed with the regiment to
which I belonged, either in the mountains, or in foraging
or bringing supplies, as circumstances dictated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Although again and again engaged in light skirmishes
with small bodies of the enemy, occupied as our own
regiment were, it was not my fortune to engage in a
general battle, until the last siege of Badajos. And
as this city was one of the most important, and its
siege the best sustained of any on the Peninsula, I
shall give an account of it more in detail than I
have thought best to do of the rest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LAST SIEGE OF BADAJOS.</div>

<p>The unfavorable issue of the two former investments,
had induced Lord Wellington to wait until a
combination of favorable circumstances should at
least give more hope of success. The auspicious
moment had, in his view, now arrived. The heavy
rains which occur at this season of the year would so
raise the rivers in the high lands, where his troops
were located, that there would be no risk of their detention
in proceeding at once to the Alemtejo, while
this same flow of waters, in the more level portion
occupied by the French, would prove a fatal impediment
to the junction of their forces, which were at
this time considerably scattered, owing to the difficulty
of obtaining provisions. Regiments were despatched,
therefore, to bring all the stores of clothing
and provisions from the different points where
they had been left, and concentrate them near Badajos.</p>

<p>Wellington himself, having remained at his headquarters,
on the Coa, until the last moment, in order
to conceal his real intentions, now came in person to
superintend the new works. As the French had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
strongly occupied the stone bridge over the Guadiana,
he ordered a flying bridge to be thrown across,
which was completed on the 15th of March, 1812.
Over this Major-general Beresford passed, and immediately
invested Badajos, with an army of fifteen
thousand men. A covering army of thirty thousand
occupied different positions near; and, including a
division on its march from Beira, the whole of the
allied forces now in Estremadura numbered fifty-one
thousand. The garrison of the enemy, composed
of French, Hessian and Spanish troops, was five
thousand strong. Phillipon, its brave commander,
had been busily occupied, since the last siege, in
strengthening the defences of the place, and in procuring
supplies for the expected invasion. Every
family was obliged to keep three months&#8217; provision
on hand, or leave the place, and every preparation
was made for an obstinate and long-continued resistance.
General Picton took the chief command of
the assailants. He was alternately assisted by Generals
Kempt, Colville, and Bowis.</p>

<p>The night of the 17th was ushered in by a violent
storm of wind and rain. It was extremely dark and
uncomfortable; but, as the loud roar of the tempest
would effectually drown the noise of the pick-axes,
eighteen hundred men were ordered to break ground
only one hundred and sixty yards from the Picurina.
They were accompanied by a guard of two thousand
men. So rapidly did they work, that, though it was
late when they commenced, before morning they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
completed a communication four thousand feet in
length, and a parallel six hundred yards long, three
feet deep, and three wide. The next night these
works were enlarged, and two batteries traced out.
To destroy these works was now the first object of
the besieged. On the 19th, thirteen hundred of their
number stole out of the city, unobserved, into the
communication, and began to destroy the parallel.
They were soon discovered, however, and driven
away. As they rode up, part of the French cavalry
entered into a mock contest, giving the countersign
in Portuguese, and were thus permitted to pass the
pickets; but they soon betrayed their real character,
and our troops, hastily seizing their arms, drove them
back to the castle, with a loss of three hundred men.
One hundred and fifty of the British fell, and, unfortunately,
Colonel Fletcher, the chief engineer, was
badly wounded. Owing to this circumstance, and
the continued wet and boisterous state of the weather,
the works advanced slowly; but the batteries were at
length completed. Owing to the heavy rains, the
parallel remained full of water, and it was found impossible
to drain it. But this was in some degree
remedied by making an artificial bottom of sandbags.
One place yet remained, on the right bank of
the Guadiana, which Wellington had not invested.
The eagle eye of Phillipon soon perceived his advantage.
He erected here three batteries, which
completely swept our works with a most destructive
fire; and its effect would have been yet greater, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
it not been that the mud obstructed the bound of the
bullets. A courier was instantly despatched to the
fifth division, stationed at Campo Mayor, for assistance.
But misfortunes seldom come alone. The
heavy rains had caused such a rise in the river, that
the flying bridges were swept away, and the trenches
filled with water. The provisions and ammunition
of the army were still on the other side of the river,
so that we were soon in want of both. To add to
this, the earth thrown up for intrenchments became
so saturated with water that it crumbled away, and
our labors were for the time wholly suspended. A few
days of fine weather, however, relieved us from our
unpleasant situation. The river subsided, another
flying bridge was constructed and row-boats obtained,
so that the communication might not again be interrupted,
under any circumstances. On the 25th the
reinforcement from Campo Mayor arrived, and the
right bank of the Guadiana was immediately invested.
The same day, our batteries were opened
upon the fort. The enemy were by no means silent
spectators of this invasion. They returned our fire
with such vigor, that several of our guns were dismounted,
and quite a number of officers killed.
Marksmen were also stationed on the trenches, to
shoot every one who should show his head over the
parapet.</p>

<p>General Picton now resolved to take the fort by
assault. Its external appearance did not indicate
much strength, and he hoped for an easy victory.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
But the event proved that these appearances were
deceptive. The fort was strong; the ditch fourteen
feet perpendicular, and guarded with thick, slanting
poles, and from the top there were sixteen feet of
an earthen slope. Seven guns were mounted on the
walls, and two hundred men, each armed with two
loaded muskets, stood ready to repel all intruders.
Loaded shells were also ranged along the walls, to be
pushed over, in case of an attack. General Kempt
took the direction of the assault, which was arranged
for the night of the 25th. Five hundred men were
selected from the third division, of which two hundred
were stationed in the communication of San
Roque, to prevent any assistance reaching the fort
from the town; one hundred occupied a position at
the right of the fort, one hundred at the left, and the
remainder were held as a reserve, under the command
of Captain Powis.</p>

<p>About nine o&#8217;clock, the signal was given, and the
troops moved forward. The night was very clear,
although there was no moon; and the fort, which had
loomed up in the darkness still and silent, as though
untenanted, answered back the first shot of the assailants
with a discharge that caused it to resemble a
sheet of fire. The first attack was directed against
the palisades in the rear; but the strength of these,
and the destructive fire poured down upon them,
obliged them to seek some weaker part. They
turned to the face of the fort; but here, the depth
of the ditch, and the slanting stakes at the top of it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
again baffled their attempts. The enemy lost not a
moment in pouring their fire upon the assailants,
and the loud death-screams told that the crisis was
becoming more and more imminent. The alarm-bells
in the city itself now rung out their shrill sounds,
the guns on the walls and on the castle opened on
the assailants, rockets were thrown up by the besieged,
and the answering shots from the trenches
served to increase the tumult. All eyes were turned
in the direction of the fort. A battalion, hastily
sent out from the city, advanced to its aid; but they
had scarcely entered the communication, when the
troops stationed there rushed to the onset, and in a
few moments they were driven back within the
walls. By the light of those streams of fire, which
ascended every moment from the Picurina, dark
forms might be seen struggling on the ramparts, in
all the energy of determined contest. Continued
rounds of artillery had broken down the palisades in
front, and the assailants were fighting, hand to hand,
for an entrance.</p>

<p>The party in the rear of the fort had thrown their
ladders, like bridges, across the ditch, resting them on
the slanting stakes, and springing on them, drove back
their guards. Fifty men, bearing axes, now discovered
the gate, which soon fell beneath their blows,
and they rushed in to a nearer contest. The little
garrison, stern in their resistance, did what they
could. Powis, Gips, Holloway and Oates, fell on
the ramparts. Nixon, Shaw, and Rudd, were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
long behind. Scarcely an officer was left; and yet
the struggle continued. At length, when only
eighty-six men remained, they surrendered, and the
Picurina passed to the allies. Only one hour had
that fierce conflict lasted, yet of our troops four
officers and fifty men had fallen, and fifteen officers
and two hundred and fifty men were wounded. Phillipon
felt deeply the loss of this fort. He did not
conceal from his soldiers the increase of danger to
their city from it; but he stimulated their courage by
reminding them that death was far preferable to an
abode in the English prison-ships. They deeply felt
that appeal, and, with the first dawn of light, their
guns were manned with renewed activity. These
were turned against the fort, and so raked it that it
was impossible for our troops to remain there, and it
was deserted. This victory gave fresh courage to
the besiegers. Our whole force was occupied, the
three succeeding nights, in erecting new batteries,
and in extending the parallels and communications.
In the daytime, comparatively little could be done,
as the fire from the town so galled the workmen.
Repeatedly they dismounted our guns, and destroyed
the defences which had been erected to shield the
laborers, so that we were obliged to wait until the
darkness prevented their marksmen from taking aim,
in order to carry on our works. The night of the
27th, an attempt was made to destroy the dam, which
had been built for the purpose of forming an inundation,
and lessening the space where our troops could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
work; but the moon had now made her appearance,
and shone so brightly that the effort was unsuccessful.</p>

<p>On this night a most daring feat was performed by
one of the French. Having disguised himself, he
crept over the wall, and concealed himself until he
had caught the watchword for the night. Then,
boldly mingling with the troops, he proceeded to the
works. Here the engineer had placed a line to mark
the direction of the sap. Just before the workmen
arrived, he moved the string, until he brought it
within complete range of the castle guns. The men
commenced work at once, but the light of the moon
enabled the guns to tell with fearful precision upon
them; and it was not until a severe loss had been
sustained, that the mistake was discovered. Meanwhile,
the intruder stole quietly back to his old
quarters, which he reached unmolested.</p>

<p>Soult, trusting to the strong intrenchments of the
place, had but little fear that it would finally surrender;
but he knew a hard-fought battle was inevitable.
He therefore endeavored, as much as possible, to
concentrate his forces near; but, while they were
marching for this purpose, Graham and Hill attacked
their flanks, and forced them to take another direction.
The whole of the Spanish army now moved
on to the Ronda hills, and threatened to attack Seville.
This movement obliged Soult to detach a large
part of his army to the assistance of this city, and
had, as the event proved, fatally delayed his march<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
to Badajos. On the 30th, Wellington received information
that Soult had resumed his march, and would
soon arrive; but this news only served to hasten the
preparations for the attack. Forty-eight pieces of
artillery were now constantly playing against the San
Roque, and the siege advanced at all points. Still
the San Roque stood firm. General Picton was the
more anxious for its destruction, as the inundation,
which was caused by the dam, and protected by this
lunette, prevented the free action of the troops.</p>

<p>On the night of the 1st of April, several brave
fellows determined to see if they could not accomplish
by stratagem what open force had failed to
effect. Two officers placed themselves at the head
of a small company of sappers. Under cover of the
darkness, and their motions encumbered by the
powder they were obliged to carry, they stole rapidly,
but noiselessly, into the camp of the enemy. It was,
indeed, a dangerous experiment. The least noise,
the slightest accident, might alarm the sentinel; and
then, they well knew, none would return to tell their
fate. Scarcely venturing to breathe, they reached,
in safety, a spot near the place. One of the officers
then went to examine the dam. During his absence,
the rest of the party could see the sentinel, as he
approached within a very few feet of where they lay
concealed. They saw, if they could dispose of him
without noise, they might probably accomplish their
aim undiscovered. The officer, having examined the
dam, now returned, just as the sentinel approached.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
&#8220;Now, boys, is your time,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;Remember,
one word, one sound, and we are lost.&#8221;
Riquet, a powerful Irishman, selected for this purpose,
seized his cloak, and stood prepared. As the
man was passing, he sprang forward, and, throwing
his cloak over him, he was in an instant gagged and
bound. Then, rapidly and silently, the powder was
placed against the dam, the train laid, and the match
applied. They waited a moment, to see that it was
not extinguished, and then hastily retreated. A few
moments passed, and the loud explosion was the first
intelligence the enemy had of the intrusion. All
eyes were bent anxiously upon the spot, but our
hopes were destined to a sad disappointment. The
dam stood firm, and the inundations still remained.
But, although this brave attempt had failed, it soon
became apparent to our general that the crisis was
rapidly approaching. The bastions of the Trinidad
and the Santa Maria had already given way; the
breaches were daily enlarging, and hope grew strong
that we should succeed in reducing the place before
Soult should arrive. Nor were the enemy blind to
their danger. They had already built a strong intrenchment
behind the walls. Now they converted
the nearest houses and garden-walls into a third line
of defence.</p>

<p>Rumors were continually circulating that the
French army was close at hand; but they were so
uncertain that no dependence could be placed upon
them. About this time, however, certain intelligence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
was brought that Soult had effected a junction with
Drouet and Daricoa, and was already at Albuera. No
time was then to be lost. Wellington himself examined
the breaches, and pronounced them practicable,
and the night of the 6th of April was fixed for the
assault. Rapidly the news circulated among the
army, and eighteen thousand daring soldiers burned
for that attack, that was to carry to posterity so
dreadful a tale. I shall never forget the effect on
our own regiment, when it was announced. General
Sponsbury himself bore the tidings, and asked if our
regiment&mdash;the 28th of foot&mdash;was willing to lead
the assault upon the castle. This offer had already
been made to the colonels of the 10th and 17th regiments;
but their men were suffering so severely from
a disease in the eyes, called the Jamaica Sands, that
they declined the honor. &#8220;My men have their eyes
open, at such a time, general,&#8221; answered our brave
colonel; &#8220;nor is their leader ever blind to the interests
of king and country.&#8221; Then, turning to us, he
cried, &#8220;What say you, my lads? Are you willing
to take the front ranks in this attack?&#8221; A loud
shout gave its affirmative to this appeal. Every heart
thrilled at the honor thus conferred, although all
knew how perilous such a distinction must necessarily
be.</p>

<p>The dreaded yet longed-for night drew on, and
our officers were busily engaged in arranging the
order of the attack, and in preparing the men for
their duty. Picton&#8217;s division was to cross the Rivillas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
river, and scale the castle walls, which were from
eighteen to twenty feet in height, furnished with every
means of destruction, and so narrow at the top that
their defenders could easily reach and overturn the
ladders.</p>

<p>To Leith was appointed the distant bastion of San
Vincente, where the glacis was mined, the ditch
deep, the scarp thirty feet high, and the defenders
of the parapet armed with three loaded muskets each,
that their first fire should be as deadly as possible.</p>

<p>The 4th and light divisions were to march against
the breaches, well furnished with ladders and axes,
preceded by storming parties of five hundred men,
with their forlorn hopes. Major Wilson, of the 48th,
was directed to storm San Roque, and to General
Power was assigned the bridge head.</p>

<p>The morning had been very clear, but, as night
approached, clouds covered the horizon, as if to veil
the bloody scenes of the night. Fog rose thick from
the rivers over every object, thus rendering the darkness
more complete. Unusual stillness prevailed,
although low murmurs pervaded the trenches, and,
on the ramparts, lights occasionally flitted here and
there. Every few moments the deep-toned voices
of the sentinels broke in upon our ears, proclaiming
that &#8220;all was well in Badajos.&#8221;</p>

<p>The possession of this place had become a point
of honor with the soldiers on both sides. Three times
had the French seen their foes sit down before these
almost impregnable walls. Twice had they been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
obliged to retire, with heavy losses. The memory of
these disasters, revenge for those who had fallen,
hatred of their foes, and a strong desire for glory,
now nerved each British arm for the contest; while
the honor of the French nation, the approval of their
idolized emperor, and, more than all, the danger to
which their families would be exposed in case of
failure, combined with an equal thirst for glory,
awakened all the ardent enthusiasm of the French.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FINAL ASSAULT.</div>

<p>At ten o&#8217;clock a simultaneous assault was to be
made on the castle, the San Roque, the breaches, the
Pardaleras, San Vincente, and the bridge head, on
the other side of the Guadiana.</p>

<p>The enemy were, as yet, all unconscious of the
design of our general, and the dark array of the
British moved slowly and silently forward. Every
heart was full; for, although now unusual quiet
reigned, every one knew that it was but the prelude
to that hour when death, in its most terrible and
ghastly forms, would be dealt on every side. In one
short half-hour the signal was to be given,&mdash;nay,
even that little time was lost. A lighted carcass
was thrown up from the castle, and fell at the very
feet of the men in the third division, casting a lurid
and glaring light for yards around. The wild shout
of alarm, the hurried tones of the signal-bells, and
the tumultuous rushing of the soldiers, proclaimed
that our array was discovered. Not a moment was
to be lost. &#8220;Forward, my men, forward!&#8221; passed
from rank to rank. One wild, long, deafening shout,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
responded, and then the besiegers dashed onward.
In a moment a circle of fire seemed to surround the
doomed city.</p>

<p>Our own division, under charge of General Kempt,
had crossed the narrow plank that constituted the
bridge over the Rivillas, under a heavy fire of
musketry, and then, re-forming, ran hastily up the
rugged hill, to the foot of the castle. Scarcely had
we reached the walls, when our brave general fell,
severely wounded. His faithful aids-de-camp carried
him from the field; and, as they were passing
to the trenches, he met General Picton,&mdash;who, hurt
by a fall, and unprepared for the advance of the signal,
had been left in the camp,&mdash;hastening onward.
A few hurried words passed between them, and
General Picton ran on, to find his brave soldiers
already ascending the heavy ladders they had placed
against the castle walls. And well might those men
be called brave, who dared attempt to ascend those
ladders, in spite of the showers of heavy stones, logs
of wood, and bursting shells, that rolled off the parapet,&mdash;regardless,
too, of that ceaseless roll of musketry,
that was telling with such fearful precision
on their flanks,&mdash;forgetting, apparently, that, even
should they live to reach the top, they could scarcely
hope to survive the shock of that formidable front of
pikes and bayonets that rose to meet them. Deafening
shouts echoed on every side, as the besieged
endeavored to throw down those heavy ladders; and
these were answered back by the groans of the dying,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
and the shrieks of the soldiers that were crushed by
their fall. Yet, not for a moment daunted, those
behind sprang on to the remaining ladders, and strove
which first should meet the death that seemed inevitable.
But their courage was fruitless. Every
ladder was thrown down, and loud shouts of victory
ran along the walls. But the British, though foiled,
were not subdued. They fell back a few paces, and
re-formed. Colonel Ridge then sprang forward, and,
seizing a ladder, placed it against the lowest part of
the castle wall, loudly calling to his men to follow.
Officer Canch succeeded in placing another beside
him, and in an instant they were fighting upon the
ramparts. Ridge fell, pierced with a hundred wounds;
but, ere his assailants had time to strike again, those
ladders had poured their living load into the castle,
and, step by step, were its brave defenders forced,
fighting, into the street. Here a reinforcement induced
them to pause, and a hard-fought conflict
ensued. But their assistants came too late,&mdash;the
castle was ours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_b_180.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">STORMING OF BADAJOS AND SCALING OF THE WALLS BY THE ENGLISH TROOPS.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>While these events were passing at the castle,
more terrific, more maddening, if possible, was
the contest at the breaches. Just as the firing at
the castle commenced, two divisions reached the
glacis. The flash of a single musket from the covered
way was the signal that the French were ready,
and yet all was still and dark. Hay packs were
thrown hastily into the ditches, and five hundred men
sprang down the ladders, which were placed there,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
without any opposition. Why was this ominous stillness?
But the assailants had hardly time to ask,
when a bright light shot up from the darkness, and
revealed all the horrors of the scene. The ramparts
were crowded with dark figures and glittering arms,
while, below, the red columns of the British were
rushing on, like streams of burning lava. A crash
of thunder followed that bright light, and hundreds
of shells and powder-barrels dashed the ill-fated
stormers into a thousand atoms. One instant the
light division paused, and then, as if maddened by
that terrific sight, they flew down the ladders, or
leaped into the gulf below. A blaze of musketry
poured its dazzling light into the ditch, as the fourth
division came up, and descended with equal fury.
But the enemy had made, at the bottom of the ditch,
a deep cut, which was filled with water. Into this
snare the head of the division fell, and more than a
hundred men were drowned. Those behind checked
not an instant, but, turning to the left, came to an
unfinished intrenchment, which they mistook for the
breaches. It was covered in a moment; but, beyond
it, still lay a deep and wide chasm, between
them and the ramparts they wished to gain. Confusion
necessarily ensued, for the assailants still
crowded on, until the ditch was full, and even then
the press continued. Not for one moment ceased
the roar of the musketry upon those crowded troops,
and the loud shouts of the enemy, mingled with the
din of bursting grenades and shells. The roaring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
guns were answered back by the iron howitzers from
the battery, while the horrid explosions of the
powder-barrels, the whizzing flight of the blazing
splinters, and the loud commands of the officers,
increased the confusion. Through all this the great
breach was at length reached, and the British trusted
that the worst was over; but, deep in those ruins,
ponderous beams were set, and, firmly fixed on their
top, glittered a terrible array of sword-blades, sharp-pointed
and keen-edged, while ten feet before even
that could be reached, the ascent was covered with
loose planks, studded with sharp iron points, which
penetrated the feet of the foremost, and sent them
rolling back on the troops behind.</p>

<p>Behind these sword-points, the shouting Frenchmen
stood rejoicing in their agony, and poured in
their fire with ceaseless rapidity; for every man had
a number of muskets, and each one of these, beside
the ordinary charge, was loaded with a cylinder of
wood, full of leaden slugs, which scattered like hail,
when discharged. Hundreds of men had fallen, and
hundreds more were dropping; but still the heroic
officers rushed on, and called for new trials. Yet,
there glittered the sword-blades, firm, immovable;
and who might penetrate such a barrier? Yet, so
zealous were the men themselves, that those behind
strove to push the forward ranks on to the blades,
that they might thus themselves ascend on a bridge
made of their bodies; but they frustrated this attempt
by dropping down, for none could tell who fell from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
choice, and who by the effect of that dreadful fire,
and many who fell unhurt never rose again, crushed
by the crowd. For a little while after the commencement
of this terrible attack, military order was
preserved; but the tumult and noise was such, that
no command could be distinctly heard; and the constant
falling and struggling of the wounded, who
sought to avoid being trampled upon, broke the
formations, and order was impossible. Yet, officers
of all stations would rush out, and, followed by their
men, make a desperate assault on that glittering
steel, and only fall back to swell the pile of dead
and dying. Two hours were spent in these vain
efforts, and then the remaining soldiers turned sadly
and slowly away; for they felt that the breach of
the Trinidad was, indeed, impregnable. An opening
still remained in the curtain of the Santa Maria
bastion, and to this they directed their steps; but
they found the approach to it impeded by deep holes
and cuts, and their fearfully lessening numbers told
how useless the attempt would be. Gathering in
dark groups, they leaned despairingly on their muskets,
and looked with sullen desperation at the
ramparts of the Trinidad, where the enemy were
seen, by the light of the fire-balls which they threw
up, aiming their guns with fearful precision, and
tauntingly asking, &#8220;Why they did not come into
Badajos?&#8221; And now, unwilling to be finally conquered,
Captains Nicholas and Shaw, with fifty men,
collected from all regiments, made one more desperate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
attempt to reach the Santa Maria breach.
Already had they passed the deep cuts, and toiled
over two-thirds of the dangerous ground, when a
discharge of musketry levelled every man, except
Shaw, to the earth. Nicholas, and a large proportion
of the rest, were mortally wounded.</p>

<p>After this, no further attempt was made; and yet
the soldiers would not retire, but remained passive
and unflinching, under the fire of the enemy. It
was now midnight. Already two thousand brave
men had fallen, when Wellington, who was watching
the progress of the attack from a height close to
the quarries, sent orders that the troops should retire
and re-form for a second assault. But so great was
the confusion, that many of the officers did not
receive the orders, and so endeavored to prevent the
soldiers from leaving, which occasioned many deaths.</p>

<p>But the gallant defenders of Badajos, although
successful at the breaches, found that there was no
time to look idly on. The whole city was girdled by
fire. The third division still maintained its ground
at the castle; the fifth were engaged at the Pardaleres,
and on the right of the Guadiana, while General
Walker&#8217;s brigade was escalading the bastion of
San Vincente. This brigade had stolen silently
along the banks of the river, the noise of its ripple
having drowned the sound of their footsteps until
they reached the barrier gate. Just then the explosion
took place at the breaches; and by its light
the French sentinels discovered their assailants. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
an instant, a sharp musketry was opened upon them.
The Portuguese troops, panic-struck, threw down
the scaling-ladders which had been intrusted to
them; but the British snatched them up, and reared
them against the walls, which, in this place, were
thirty feet high. Unfortunately, the ladders were too
short, and this placed them in a most perilous and
uncomfortable position. A small mine was sprung
beneath their feet, adding its quota to the fearful
number of the dead; beams of wood and shells,
fraught with living fire, were rolled upon their
heads, while showers of grape from the flanks swept
the ditch, dealing death-blows thick and fast on
every side. But, fortunately for our troops, the reinforcement
to assist in the defence of the castle was
just at this time called for, and a part of the walls
lower than the rest was left unmanned. Three ladders
were hastily placed here, but they were still too
short. But British valor and ingenuity soon overcame
this difficulty. A soldier, raised in the arms
of his comrades, sprang to the top; another followed.
These drew their comrades after them, and soon, in
spite of the constant fire which the French kept up,
they ascended in such numbers, that they could not
be driven back. Dividing, on their entrance, one-half
entered the town, while the other, following the
ramparts, attacked and won three bastions. Just as
the last was yielding, General Walker fell, covered
with wounds. A soldier, who stood near him,
cried out, &#8220;A mine! a mine!&#8221; At that word,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
those troops which had crossed the strong barrier,
whom neither the deepness of the ditch nor the
height of the wall could appal, who flinched not
a moment at the deadly fire of the enemy, shrank
back at a chimera of their own raising. Their
opponents saw their advantage, and, making a firm
and deadly charge, drove them from the ramparts.
But, before the French had time to rejoice in their
victory, a reserve, under Colonel Nugent, made its
appearance, and the fleeing soldiers returned, and
soon gained the field.</p>

<p>The party who had entered the town at the first
attack on San Vincente pursued their way through
the streets. They met with no opposition, however.
All was still and silent as the grave, and yet the
streets were flooded with light, and every house
illuminated. Sounding their bugles, they advanced
to the great square of the town, but still met no
enemy. All was bright and still, except that low
murmurs were heard from behind the lattices, and
occasionally a shot was fired at them from under the
doors. Hence, leaving the square, they repaired to
the breaches, and attempted to surprise the garrison,
by attacking them in their rear. But they found
them on the alert, and were soon obliged to return
to the streets. But the English were now pouring
in on every side, and the brave defenders of the
ramparts and the breaches turned to defend their
homes. A short and desultory fight followed.
Generals Viellande and Phillipon, brave and determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
to the last, were both wounded; and, gradually
falling back, they retreated, with a few hundred
soldiers, to San Christoval, where they surrendered to
Lord Fitzroy Somerset. Then loud shouts of
victory! victory! resounded through the streets, and
found its joyful echo in many hearts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SACK OF THE CITY.</div>

<p>During this siege, five thousand men and officers
had fallen; thirty-five hundred having lost their
lives the night of the assault,&mdash;twenty-four hundred
at the breaches alone. If any one would picture to
himself the terrible scenes that occured at this spot,
let him imagine a lot of less than a hundred square
yards, which, in the short space of little more than
two hours, was deluged by the blood of twenty-four
hundred men. Nor did all these fall by sudden
death. Some perished by steel, some by shot, some
were drowned, some crushed and mangled by heavy
weights, others trampled down by the crowd, and
hundreds dashed to pieces by the fiery explosions;
and all this occurred where the only light was the
intense glare of the explosions, and the lurid flame
of the burning dead, which came to mingle its horrible
stench with the sickening odors of the gunpowder,
and the nauseous smells of the exploding
shells. Here, too, the groans of the wounded were
echoed back by the shrieks of the dying; and, ever
and anon, between the roar of the artillery and the
thunder of the bursting shells, were heard the bitter
taunts of the enemy. Let any one imagine all this,
I say, and they may have some faint ideas of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
horrors of war. Yet, dreadful as this is, could the
veil but drop here, the soldier&#8217;s heart might still
throb with pride, as he recounted the hard-fought
battle, where valor stood preëminent, and none
yielded, but to death, until the victory was won.
But there is still another dark and revolting page,
which, in a history like this, designed to paint the
horrors as well as the glories of war, it were not well
to omit. I refer to the scenes which followed the
victory, when Badajos lay at the mercy of its conquering
foe. If there is one feature of war more
repulsive than another, one from which every good
feeling of the heart shrinks back appalled, it is from
the scene which invariably follows, when permission
is given to sack and plunder a conquered city. All
restraint is laid aside. Men&#8217;s passions, wound up
almost to frenzy by the exciting and maddening
scenes through which they have passed, will have a
vent; and no sorrow is too holy, no place too
sacred, to shield its occupant from the storm. Our
men scattered themselves through the city, all with
liberty to do what they pleased, to take what they
wanted. Houses were broken open, and robbed.
If any resistance was made, death was the certain
penalty; and often death in such a form that a
soldier&#8217;s fate would have been mercy. All, it is
true, were not alike. In such an army there are
always brave men, who, even in such an hour, would
scorn to commit a dishonorable action, and these
seconded the attempts of our officers to preserve at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
least a semblance of order; but they were too few
to accomplish much. All the dreadful passions of
human nature were excited, and they would have
way. Many lost their lives in vain attempts to check
the cruelty and lust and drunkenness of their own
soldiers. For two days and nights Badajos resounded
with the shrieks and piteous lamentations
of her defenceless victims, with groans and shouts
and imprecations, varied by the hissing of fires from
houses first plundered, then destroyed, the crashing
of doors and windows, and the almost ceaseless report
of muskets used in violence. It was not until
the third day that the soldiers, exhausted by their
own excesses, could be collected in sufficient numbers
to bury the dead of their own regiments, while
many of the wounded perished solely from want of
necessary care. I had imagined that the miseries
of intemperance were no unfamiliar sight to me; yet
never before, or since, has it been my lot to meet the
madness which characterized the eager search for
liquor, on every side. An instance that occurred in
our own regiment, I will relate. Several of our
men, and among them some that I had known in
Ireland, and should never have suspected of such
conduct, broke into a cellar where was stored a large
quantity of wine. There were many casks, and some
of them contained wine that bore the brand of scores
of years. They tore down the doors for tables, and
commenced their mad feast. Bottles half emptied
were thrown across the cellar, and what would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
sufficed a regiment for months, was recklessly poured
upon the floor. Unconscious, or not caring what they
did, they stopped not to draw the wine, but, knocking
in the head of the casks, proceeded to try their various
qualities. At length, overcome by intoxication,
they sank upon the floor, and paid the penalty of
their rashness with their lives; for, when a diligent
search was made for absentees, they were discovered
actually drowned in the wine. Many were burned
to death in houses which they themselves had fired.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A DISCOVERY.</div>

<p>For my own part, I had been fortunate enough to
pass through all the horrors of the siege, and the
bloody scenes of the assault, unhurt. Excitement
had rendered me reckless of danger, and I hurried
on, scarce knowing where I was or what I did.
Now that this had passed, I felt exhausted and
weary, and very thirsty. My comrade and myself
resolved that our first search should be for something
to drink. We hurried on, until we reached a large
store, where we thought we should find some liquor.
The fastenings of the outer door soon yielded to our
efforts, but the door to the cellar we found it impossible
to open or break down. Just at this moment,
a band of pioneers happened to be passing, who
always carry with them huge hatchets. We called
to them, and, with their assistance, soon made our
way to the cellar. But here a great disappointment
awaited us. We found no liquor, but only two
tiers of firkins, used for holding butter. One of our
men, in anger, struck his hatchet into one of them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
when, to our great surprise, out rolled whole handfuls
of doubloons. We then struck the heads of the
firkins with the butt-ends of our muskets, but could
not break them. The hatchets, however, soon completed
the work. When the heads were knocked
out, the money was so firmly pressed together that
it came out in one solid mass. Each one of us then
took what we pleased. I placed three handsful in
my comrade&#8217;s knapsack, and he did the same by me.
I then filled my haversack, and even my stockings,
with the precious treasure. Part of our company
remained as guard, while the rest went to report to
our commander the discovery we had made. I soon
found that I had stored more money than I was able
to carry, so I threw a part of it in an old well. Our
commander immediately sent a detachment of men to
empty the cellar, and they brought away no less than
eight mules&#8217; burden of gold. I cannot now recall its
exact amount, but such was its value that our officers
determined to send it to Brussels, when the army
should leave Badajos.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ATROCIOUS CONDUCT OF THE VICTORS.</div>

<p>We take the following description of the scenes to
which we have above referred from an eye-witness.
He says: &#8220;It has been the practice of modern historians
to describe, in the glowing language of exaggerated
eulogy, every act done by the British and
their allies, while their pens have been equally busy
in vilifying and defaming all who were opposed to
them. Perhaps there is no circumstance to which
this applies with more force than the description<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
usually given of the conduct of the British armies
and their allies after the taking of Badajos. While
their gallantry is praised to the utmost, their evil
deeds are left to find the light as they may; but
&#8216;foul deeds will rise, though all the earth overwhelm
them.&#8217;&#8221; Before six o&#8217;clock on the morning of the 7th
of April, all organization among the assaulting columns
had ceased, and a scene of plunder and cruelty
that it would be difficult to find a parallel for
took place. The army, so orderly the preceding day,&mdash;so
effective in its organizations,&mdash;seemed all at
once transformed into a vast band of brigands. The
horde of Spaniards, as well as Portuguese women and
men, that now eagerly sought for admission to plunder,
augmented the number of this band to what the
army had been before the battle; and twenty thousand
persons, armed with all power to act as they
thought fit, and almost all armed with weapons
which could be used at the pleasure of the bearers,
for the purpose of enforcing any wish they might
seek to gratify, were let loose upon this devoted city.
Subject to no power of control from others, intoxication
caused them to lose all restraint on themselves.
If the reader can for a moment fancy a fine city, containing
an immense population, among which may be
reckoned a proportion of the finest women Spain, or
perhaps the world, can boast of,&mdash;if he could fancy
that population and these women left to the mercy
of twenty thousand infuriated and licentious soldiers,
for two days and two nights, he can well imagine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
the horrors enacted in Badajos. Wine and spirit
stores were first forced open, and casks of the choicest
wines and brandy dragged into the streets; and, when
the men had drank as much as they fancied, the heads
of the vessels were stove in, or the casks broken, so
that the liquor ran about in streams. In the town
were large numbers of animals,&mdash;sheep, oxen, and
horses,&mdash;belonging to the garrison. These were
among the first things taken possession of; and the
wealthy occupier of many a house was glad to be
allowed the employment of conducting them to our
camp, as, by so doing, he got away from a place
where his life was not worth a minute&#8217;s purchase.
Terrible as was this scene, it was not possible to avoid
occasionally laughing; for the <i>conducteur</i> was generally
not only compelled to drive a herd of cattle, but
also obliged to carry the bales of plunder taken by
his employer perhaps from his own house. And the
stately gravity with which the Spaniard went through
his work, dressed in short breeches, frilled shirt, and
a hat and plumes, followed by our ragamuffin soldiers
with fixed bayonets, presented a scene that Cruikshank
himself would have been puzzled to delineate
justly. The plunder so captured was deposited under
a guard composed principally of soldiers&#8217; wives. A
few hours were sufficient to despoil the shops of their
property. Night then closed in, and then a scene
took place that pen would fail to describe. Insult
and infamy, fiendish acts of violence and open-handed
cruelty, everywhere prevailed. Age, as well as youth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
was alike unrespected, and perhaps not one house,
and scarcely a person, in this vast town, escaped injury.
War is a terrible engine, and when once set
in motion, it is not possible to calculate when or where
it will stop.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TERRIBLE DISORDER.</div>

<p>&#8220;The 8th of April was a fearful day for the inhabitants.
The soldiers had become so reckless that
no person&#8217;s life, of whatever sex, rank, or station, was
safe. If they entered a house that had not been despoiled
of its furniture and wines, they were at once
destroyed. If it was empty, they fired at the windows,
or at the inmates, or often at each other. Then
they would sally into the streets, and amuse themselves
by firing at the church bells in the steeples, or
at any one who might be passing. Many of the soldiers
were killed, while carrying away their plunder,
by the hands of those who, a few hours before, would
have risked their own lives to protect them. Hundreds
of these fellows took possession of the best
warehouses, and acted as merchants; these were
ejected by a stronger party, who, after a fearful
strife, would displace them, only themselves to give
place to others, with terrible loss of life. To put a
stop to such a frightful scene, it was necessary to use
some forbearance, as well as severity; for, to have
punished all who were guilty would have been to
decimate the army. In the first instance, parties
from those regiments that had least participated in
the combat were ordered into the town to collect the
hordes of stragglers, that filled the streets with crimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
too horrible to detail; and, when this measure was
found inadequate, a brigade of troops were marched
into the city, and were directed to stand by their
arms, while any marauders remained. Gibbets and
triangles were erected, and many of the men were
flogged. A few hours so employed were sufficient
to purge the town of the robbers that still lurked in
the streets, many of whom were Spaniards and Portuguese,
not connected with the army, and infinitely
worse than our troops. Towards evening tranquillity
began to return; but it was a fearful quiet, and
might be likened to a ship at sea, which, after having
been plundered and dismasted by pirates, should be
left floating on the ocean, without a morsel of food
to supply the wants of its crew, or a stitch of canvas
to cover its naked masts. By degrees, however, the
inhabitants returned, and families left alive again
became reünited; yet there was scarce a family that
did not mourn its dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>The same writer says: &#8220;Early on the morning of
the 9th of April, a great concourse of Spaniards,
from the neighboring villages, thronged our lines.
They came to purchase the booty captured by our
men; and each succeeding hour increased the supply
of their wants, numerous and varied as they were,
and our camp had the appearance of a vast market.
Some of the soldiers realized upwards of one thousand
dollars from the sale, and almost all gained
handsomely by an enterprise in which they had displayed
so much devotion and bravery; and it is only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
to be lamented that they tarnished laurels so nobly
won, by traits of barbarity which, for the sake of
human nature, we hope have not often found a parallel.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not until order was in some measure restored
that the wounded and dead could be attended
to; but now graves were dug, and the mangled
remains, so lately full of life and activity, burning
with high hopes and fond anticipations, were laid
away, adding their numbers to the vast pile of victims
sacrificed to that Moloch&mdash;war. It is said that
when Wellington learned the number of the fallen,
and the extent of his loss in the death of those brave
men, a passionate burst of tears told how much he
was affected by it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WELLINGTON STILL AT BADAJOS.</div>

<p>For a few days Wellington lingered near Badajos,
hoping that Soult, to whom Phillipon had sent the
fatal news even in the confusion of his surrender,
would be tempted from his intrenchments to risk a
battle with the allies, while the troops were flushed
with victory. But this general, although feeling
deeply the loss of one of his most impregnable fortresses,
found himself too much occupied with the
other division of the allied army to venture on such
a course.</p>

<p>It was Wellington&#8217;s intention, in case this battle
did not take place, to proceed immediately to Andalusia;
but, learning that the Spanish general had
failed to garrison the fortresses already taken in a
suitable manner, he was obliged to alter his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
course of action, in order to secure former conquests.
While he remained here, his time was busily occupied
in repairing the breaches, in levelling the
trenches, and restoring the injured fortifications.
This being done, he placed here, as a garrison, two
regiments of Portuguese, and marched himself, with
the main body of his troops, upon Beira.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Soon</span> after our army left Badajos, the remarkable
and interesting adventures of Sir Colquhoun Grant,
who was an officer in our army, attracted general
attention; and, though I did not myself learn all
the particulars I am about to relate until after my
return from the continent, they are in themselves of
so interesting a nature, and so closely connected with
the success of our arms in the Peninsula, that I trust
my readers will deem these reasons a sufficient excuse
for their introduction here.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ADVENTURES OF SIR COLQUHOUN GRANT.</div>

<p>Intelligence had been brought to our commander
that the army of Portugal, under Marmont, was concentrating
on the Tormes, and that they were intending
to attack the fortresses of Almeida and Ciudad.
If this was indeed so, it was all-important that he
should immediately march to their relief, as their
garrisons and stores were far too weak to sustain an
attack or stand a siege. But, as Wellington could
not believe that the French general would take what
seemed to him so imprudent a course, he suspected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
that this information was only a ruse to draw him
from his position. It was absolutely necessary that
he should know the truth. Among his troops was
an officer named Colquhoun Grant. Gentlemanly
and peculiarly attractive in his manners, bold even to
the utmost daring, and yet with so much subtlety of
genius, tempered with the wisest discretion, he
seemed exactly fitted by nature for the dangerous
and delicate office which our commander-in-chief
intrusted to him, which was to watch Marmont&#8217;s
proceedings, and, if possible, to learn his true intentions.
He secured the services of a Spanish peasant,
named Leon, whose own life it had been his
good fortune to preserve in a skirmish, and whose
only sister Grant had rescued from the guerillas, just
as they were bearing her off. So grateful was poor
Leon, that he esteemed himself only too happy in
being allowed to share his master&#8217;s danger in this
perilous enterprise. Having passed the Tormes in
the night, as morning was breaking, he rode boldly up
to the French camp, dressed in his own uniform and
followed by his servant. In answer to the challenge
of the sentinel on duty, he informed him that he was
the bearer of a message to one of the principal officers
of the French army, and was admitted without
hesitation. The wife of this officer had accompanied
her husband to Spain, and was in Badajos at
the time of its surrender. During the excesses
which followed, her house was entered by some ruffians,
and she would have fallen a victim to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
rage, had it not been for the timely interference of
Grant, who rescued her from her assailants, and bore
her to a place of comparative safety. As a small
memento of her gratitude, when the army left, she
wrote him a note expressing her heartfelt thanks,
and accompanied it by a valuable ring. Armed with
the note and ring, he proceeded at once to the tent of
the officer, who gladly received him as the bearer of
information from his wife, and invited him to share
the hospitalities of the camp. Here he remained
for three days, and, by his adroitness in conversation,
obtained exact information as to Marmont&#8217;s
object, and the preparation he had made, both of provisions
and scaling-ladders. While there, each day
a Spanish peasant made his appearance in the camp,
laden with fruit for sale; and while Grant was apparently
busy in purchasing, he conveyed to him notes of
his information, which were immediately carried to
Wellington. Just before the night sentinels had
taken their posts on the third evening, while he
was in earnest conversation with a number of the
French officers, he heard the low signal of the
peasant outside the tent. He succeeded in excusing
his absence in such a manner as not to attract observation,
and received the alarming intelligence that
he was known to be in the French cantonments, and
that a general order was even now circulating, giving
a description of his person, and commanding the soldiers
to use their utmost exertions to secure him.
Guards had already been stationed in a circle round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
the army, and escape seemed impossible. Not a
moment was to be lost. Leaving his horse with
Leon, who was to meet him at Huerta at daybreak,
he crept past the sleeping soldiers, and succeeded in
reaching that village undiscovered. But it was now
daybreak, and the outward circle of the guards was
yet to be passed. Before him lay a deep river,
fordable only at one point, and along which videttes
were posted, constantly patrolling back and forward,
meeting at the ford, while the whole battalion was
engaged in the search. Yet these difficulties did not
daunt him. Leon and Grant met at the house of a
peasant, one of his agents, who had several of his
friends, wrapped in their large Spanish cloaks, ready
to assist him. They advanced towards the ford, one
of them leading his horse, and the others spreading
their cloaks, as if estimating their comparative width.
Under this cover, he stole along down to the ford.
Here, waiting until the sentinels had separated their
utmost distance, which was three hundred yards, he
boldly mounted his horse, and dashed into the river.
They both fired, but without success, and, without
stopping to reload, pursued him. A wood lay directly
before him. This covert he reached in safety, and was
soon hid in its recesses. Here his faithful Leon joined
him, and all pursuit of both was baffled. Grant here
ascertained that the French were preparing to storm
Ciudad Rodrigo, or, at least, that they conversed
freely of doing so. From this fact, he judged it
might be only a mask of their real intentions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
These, if possible, together with their numbers and
the direction of their march, he wished to discover.
He therefore concealed himself in the branches of
a high tree, just where the road directs its course to
the passes, and beneath which the whole army must
proceed. Here he counted every battalion and gun,
and found that their course was directed against Ciudad.
When the last soldier was out of sight, he
descended from the tree, and, entering the village
they had just left, he discovered all the scaling-ladders
securely stored. He immediately wrote to Wellington
that he need have no fears for that fortress.</p>

<p>His next object was to discover whether Marmont
was marching upon Castello Branco or Coimbra. To
reach the former place, it was necessary to descend
to the pass by a succession of ridges. He stationed
himself on one of the lowest of these, thinking that
the dwarf oaks, of which there was here a thick
growth, would hide him; but, as the French officers
were descending from the ridge above, they happened
to spy him with their glasses, and despatched some
dragoons in pursuit. Leon&#8217;s lynx eyes, always on
the watch, soon perceived them, and, alarming his
master, they rode forward a short distance, and then
wheeled in another direction. But now the alarm
had spread, and all over the wood the soldiers were
engaged in eager search. Finding every pass beset
by their enemies, they left their horses, and fled on
foot through the thickest of the oaks. But these
were not thick enough to veil them from the officers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
on the higher ridges, who, by the waving of their
hats, directed the chase. Efforts like these could not
last long. Leon fell, exhausted, and Grant refused
to yield to his entreaties to leave him. The enemy
soon made their appearance, and, in despite of the
earnest entreaties and prayers of Grant, they killed
poor Leon, and carried Grant to Marmont&#8217;s tent.
This general received him apparently with much
kindness, and invited him to dinner. While seated
at the table, he conversed freely with his prisoner,
but closed by exacting from him a parole that he
would not suffer himself to be released by the Partidas
while passing through Spain. When Wellington
discovered the capture of this faithful servant,
he offered a reward of two thousand dollars to any
one who would release him. Marmont then placed
his prisoner under a strong escort, and sent him to
France. He also sent with him a letter to the governor
of Bayonne, designating him as a dangerous
spy, and recommending the governor to send him, in
irons, immediately to Paris. The gentlemanly conduct
of Grant, during his journey, and his lion-hearted
bravery, so won upon the esteem of one of
the officers of his escort, that he acquainted him with
the contents of the letter, before reaching Bayonne.
It was the custom for the prisoners, on their arrival
in this city, to wait on the authorities, and procure a
passport to Verdun. His friend the officer succeeded
in delaying the delivery of Marmont&#8217;s letter until
these formalities had been attended to. Grant&#8217;s object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
then would be to rejoin his regiment in Spain;
but he well knew that the search for him would be
made in that direction. He, therefore, resolved to
go to Paris, because he judged that if the governor
of Bayonne did not succeed in recapturing him, he
would, for his own security, suppress the letter, in
hopes the matter would be no further thought of. He
therefore went directly to the hotels, and, finding
that General Souham was going there on his return
from Spain, he boldly introduced himself, and requested
permission to join his party. Now, Souham
had often heard of Grant, and was extremely pleased
to make his acquaintance, and of course yielded a
ready assent to his proposal. On their way, he conversed
freely with him about his adventures, little
thinking that he was aiding him in one of the most
skilful of them all. While passing through Orleans,
he had the good fortune to meet an English agent,
who gave him a recommendation to another secret
agent in Paris, whose assistance would be of great
use to him in effecting his final escape. When he
arrived in Paris, he took his leave of Souham, and
then went directly to the house of the Parisian agent.
This gentleman received him with much kindness,
and having ascertained that no inquiry had been set
on foot about his escape, furnished him with a sum
of money, and recommended to him to take rooms in a
very public street, and to attend and be interested in
the amusements of the city. He even appeared at
the theatres, and frequented the coffee-houses, as his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
friend was connected with the police, and would give
him seasonable warning, in case he should be suspected.
Several weeks passed away in this manner,
when it so happened that an American&mdash;one of his
fellow-lodgers who was just preparing to return home&mdash;was
taken suddenly ill, and died. The evening
before his death, as Grant was sitting by his side, his
passport was brought to him, and laid upon a table
near. It occurred to Grant, that, in case of his death,
he might possess himself of this passport without
injury to any one, which he accordingly did, and
proceeded at once with it, unquestioned, to the mouth
of the Loire. He was delighted to find here a ship
just ready to sail for America. He went on board
and engaged his passage, and was told that the ship
would sail by noon. An hour had not elapsed, however,
when a despatch was received from Paris,
informing the captain that important reasons existed
why he should delay his journey. The captain,
annoyed by this interference with his views, mentioned
it to his passengers; and Grant, seeing at once
that he was in danger, threw himself upon the captain&#8217;s
mercy, by frankly explaining to him his real
situation. This officer kindly entered at once into
his plans, advising him to assume the character of a
discontented sailor. Grant then dressed as a sailor,
and, with forty dollars in money which the captain
gave him for that purpose, went to the American
consul, and deposited in his hands the money, as a
pledge that he would prosecute the captain for ill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
treatment, when he should arrive in the States. In
return for this, the consul furnished him with the
certificate of a discharged sailor, which permitted
him to pass from port to port, as if in search of a
ship. He wandered about thus for some days, when
one day he saw a boatman sitting idly in his boat,
apparently with nothing to do. He accosted him,
and, thinking that he might be moulded to his purpose,
he offered him ten Napoleons, if he would row
him to a small island which appeared in the distance,
where English ships often stopped to take in water.
The boatman agreed to do so that night. The evening
was fair, and the boat made rapid progress.
Already the island rose upon their view in the distance,
and beyond it loomed up the dark masts of
the English vessel which was the harbor of safety
and happiness to Grant. Already he had deemed
himself almost beyond the reach of danger, when
suddenly he perceived that the course of his guide
was altered. He demanded the reason of this, but
no answer was returned. Drawing a knife from his
pocket, he was about to enforce his demand, when
suddenly two men sprang up from the bottom of the
boat, where they had been concealed, and he saw that
to struggle against his fate would be useless. Still, his
courage did not desert him. He would yet be free.
The dastardly boatman offered to proceed to the island,
if more money was paid him; but Grant, when he
had promised his ten Napoleons, had spent the last
of his little stock, and the boatman, notwithstanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
his breach of contract, demanded the whole. This
demand, with great coolness and the utmost resolution,
was refused by Grant. One Napoleon he should
have, but no more. The boatman threatened to denounce
him to the police; but Grant, always prepared,
told him, if he did, that he would at once
accuse him of aiding the escape of a prisoner of war,
and would adduce the great price of his boat as the
proof of his guilt. This menace was too powerful
to be resisted, and Grant was allowed to depart unmolested.
In a few days Grant engaged a fisherman,
who, with his son, pursued his calling on the coast,
to carry him to the island. The bargain was this
time faithfully performed; but fortune seemed everywhere
against him. There was not a ship at the
island, and it was far too small for him to venture to
try concealment there. His next course was to exchange
clothes with the fisherman&#8217;s son, and take his
place in the boat. Having spent some time in fishing,
they gradually bore off to the south, where
rumor said a large English ship-of-war was to be
found. In a few hours they obtained a glimpse of
her, and were steering that way, when a shot from
a coast battery brought them to a full stop, and a
boat full of soldiers put off to board them. Hope
again died away in the heart of the adventurous traveller,
at that dreaded sight; but he would not yet
despair. The boat drew near, and the fisherman,
poor and needy, had now an opportunity of enriching
<i>himself</i>, by denouncing his passenger. But the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
man was true to his trust. He assured the soldiers
that Grant was his son; and, convinced of this, they
only warned him not to go out of the reach of the
guns of the battery, because the English vessel was
on the coast. But the fisherman, having given all
the fish he had caught to the soldiers, told them if he
did not, his poor family would starve,&mdash;that this was
their only dependence,&mdash;and assured them that he
was so well acquainted with the coast that he could
always escape the enemy. His prayers and presents
prevailed, and he was desired to wait under the battery
till night, and then depart; but, under pretence
of arranging his escape from the English vessel, he
made the soldiers point out her bearings so exactly,
that when the darkness came, he lost not a moment
in proceeding on board, and the intrepid Grant soon
found himself once more in safety on her quarter-deck.
The vessel soon sailed for England, and
Grant was received in London with all the popularity
which his arduous services demanded, and might now
have obtained an honorable release from the toilsome
service in which he had been engaged; but he was
a true soldier at heart, and loved the toil and bustle
of the camp, with all its hardships, far better than
the ease and comfort of courts. He asked but one
favor of his royal master, and this was to select a
French officer, of equal rank, who should be sent
back to his own country, that no doubt might remain
of the propriety of his escape. This he received
permission to do; and he visited one of the prisons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
where the French were detained, for the purpose of
making his selection. Judge what must have been
his astonishment, when the first person he saw was
the old fisherman who had so befriended him in his
trouble! The recognition was mutual; and the old
man, whose heart longed for the old familiar haunts
of his childhood, out of sight of which he had never
been before, felt once more the dawn of hope in his
bosom, as he saw that face, so full of benevolence and
kindness, bent on him in pitying sorrow. His story
was soon told. He and his son, venturing on the
pass which Grant had given him in return for his
kindness, had ventured out to sea in too near proximity
to an English vessel. The captain, totally
unmindful of their papers, had sunk their little boat,
their only property, and brought them away to inhabit
an English prison, while his poor family was
starving at home. The indignant Grant could scarcely
listen to the conclusion of the tale. He immediately
obtained their release, made them a present of a sum
of money and a new boat, and saw them once more
embarked for France, blessing the happy hour when
they had shown such kindness to one so richly deserving
of it. He then returned himself to the Peninsula,
and, within four months from the time of his
capture, he was again on the Tormes, watching the
army of Marmont, and only mourning that poor Leon
was no longer alive to accompany him.</p>

<p>Hoping that my readers will be interested in this
long digression, I will return at once to my own story.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PASS OF RONCESVALLES.</div>

<p>Before the victorious army of the allies left Badajos,
Wellington determined to send a convoy to
Brussels with the treasure and spoils found in that
place. The regiments selected to form this convoy
were the 28th, the 80th, and 87th and 43d. We
were to leave Badajos, and pass through the northern
part of Spain to Pampeluna, and through the
romantic gorge of the Roncesvalles to St. Jean Pied
de Port, in France, and from this place take the
most direct course to Brussels. The day before our
army was to leave for Beira was the day selected
for our march. Our farewell words were soon spoken,
and we were on our way. No event of consequence
had marked our course until we were near Pampeluna.
On the left of this place, near Roncesvalles,
is the beautiful valley of Bastan, one of the most
fertile and delightful valleys in Spain, and abounding
in every species of plenty. From Pampeluna to
Zabieta, the road passes over a gentle ascent. From
Zabieta this ascent increases, and becomes extremely
rough and fatiguing near the village of Borquette.
From this village it begins to ascend very lofty
mountains, but which are extremely fertile and well
wooded. Immediately after passing Borquette, the
road ascends a mountain, and then descends the
same, when it enters upon the memorable plain of
Roncesvalles, where happened that memorable defeat
of Charlemagne, which has furnished so copious a
theme for poetry and romance. As there are few
who have not heard of this celebrated pass, perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
the legend connected with it may not be uninteresting
to my readers.</p>

<p>Several Moorish chiefs, in the north-western part
of Spain, had implored the protection of this celebrated
emperor, and invited him to accept their
vassalage. He at once assembled an army, crossed
the Pyrenees, penetrated as far as Saragossa, and
received the submission of all the neighboring lords.
News of threatened hostilities on the Rhenish frontiers
caused him to hasten his march onward. Dividing
his army into two bodies, he advanced, in
person, at the head of the first division, leaving all
the baggage with the rear guard, which comprised a
strong force, and was commanded by some of the
most renowned of his chieftains, among whom was
Roland, the nephew of Charlemagne. Mounted on
heavy horses, and loaded with a complete armor of
iron, the soldiers pursued their march through the
narrow passes of the Pyrenees, without suspecting
the neighborhood of an enemy. The king himself,
with his first division, passed from these intricate
woods and narrow defiles unmolested; but when the
rear body, following leisurely at a considerable distance,
had reached this wild and lonely valley, the
woods and rocks around them suddenly bristled into
life, and they were attacked on all sides by the perfidious
Gascons, whose light arms, swift arrows, and
knowledge of the country, gave them every advantage
over their opponents. In the first panic and
confusion, the Franks were driven down to the bottom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
of the pass, embarrassed by their arms and baggage.
The Gascons pressed them on every point, and
slaughtered them like a herd of deer, singling them
out with their arrows from above, and rolling down
the rocks upon their heads. Never wanting in courage,
they fought until the last moment, and died
unconquered. Roland and his companions, the twelve
peers of France, after innumerable deeds of valor,
were slain with the rest; and the Gascons, satiated
with carnage, and rich in plunder, dispersed among
the mountains, leaving Charlemagne to seek fruitlessly
for vengeance.</p>

<p>During the lapse of many centuries, tradition has
hung about this famous spot, and the memory of
Roland and his companions has been consecrated in
a thousand shapes throughout the country. When
we entered this famous pass, we could but recall the
legends connected with it. The mountains rose high
and towering to the skies on either side. Far up
their rocky sides we could see mountain paths descending,
while here and there a shelf would exist
that might give a standing-place to a body of men.
Huge crags seemed to bid defiance even to the fleet
steps of the mountain goat, while deep caverns
opened their mouths on every side, giving shelter to
the hordes of banditti which always infest those
regions. The stroke of Roland&#8217;s sword upon the
rocks was pointed out to us by our guides; while,
just beneath, we noticed patches of the beautiful
little wild-flower of the Pyrenees, which is called the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
casque of Roland. I know of no fitter place for the
assault which took place here; certainly none which
could give the assailants a better advantage. But,
ominous as the scenery appeared, we crossed this
famous pass in safety, and emerged, with gladdened
and lightened hearts, on the plain beyond, where
rises the beautiful and venerable abbey of Roncesvalles,
whose moss-clad walls, which have felt so
heavily, and yet sustained so well, the hand of time,
are covered with mementos of its famous hero. On
the further side of this plain, the road, after passing
over a small elevation, reaches the foot of that tremendous
mountain, called Mount Altobiscar, which
separates France from Spain. The ascent to this is
very steep and laborious, and almost impassable for
carriages. A ravine descends from this into French
Navarre. Our party were leisurely descending into
this ravine, hardly anticipating danger, when suddenly
our advance guards were stopped by the report
of a musket. The alarm was in a moment given,
and our arms prepared. On the huge rocks which
rose above us a body of men were seen descending,
and in a moment they were upon us, preceding their
arrival by rolling huge stones down from the mountain,
which killed a number of our men. In a moment
we had formed ourselves, as far as the position
of the ground would admit, into two squares; and,
as they drew near, we discharged our muskets into
the midst. Nearly all the foremost fell; but their
places were soon supplied by others, who came on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
with still more force. Their subtle chief was very
active in the affray. Fortunately, we had gained a
part of the ground where there was a wide shelf,
which enabled us to meet the attack more in a body,
while the road to it was narrow, and the ground
rough. Consequently, they fell fast before our fire.
A few minutes only the combat lasted, and yet, on
our own side, a hundred men had fallen. Fifty were
killed outright; and in several places men and horse
had died simultaneously, and so suddenly, that, falling
together on their sides, they appeared still alive,&mdash;the
horse&#8217;s legs stretched out as in movement, the
rider&#8217;s feet in the stirrups, his bridle in hand, the
sword raised to strike, and the expression of the
countenance undistorted, but with such a look of
resolution and defiance as gave to it a ghastly and
supernatural appearance. The loss of the assailants
was still greater than ours. Seeing that it would be
impossible to attain their object, which was, doubtless,
to possess themselves of our baggage, they
retired in good order; and, as we considered our
charge too valuable to be left in such a spot, we did
not attempt to pursue them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ARRIVAL AT BRUSSELS.</div>

<p>No other incident of interest occurred in our route,
and we found ourselves, on the 3d of June, in safety
in Brussels. The next day we reported our arrival
to the commanders there; and, on the 5th, our charge
was delivered up, and we were inspected, and then
ordered to join the garrison which was stationed in
Brussels. Here I remained, only performing garrison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
duty, until that great battle which decided
the fate of Europe, and sent the French emperor to
his last and lonely home on the barren rock of St.
Helena.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">These</span> four years thus spent to me were days of
quiet, unmarked by aught that would interest my
readers; but four years more eventful, more fraught
with heavy consequences of good or ill to Europe,
have seldom&mdash;perhaps never&mdash;been numbered in her
eventful history. The victorious banners of France
were waving on every battle-field on the continent.
Wagram and Jena, Austerlitz and Friedland, echoed
back the glory of the conqueror&#8217;s name; and kings
and emperors, in whose veins flowed the blood of the
Cæsars, had esteemed it an honor to claim alliance
with the plebeian child of Corsica. But the Russian
bear and the English lion had not yet yielded to his
claims; and, gathering his vast and victorious armies,
he led them to face a sterner enemy and a more
subtle foe than they had ever yet contested. Half
a million of men, firm and confident in their own
resources, had crossed the Niemen under Bonaparte&#8217;s
approving eye. A few months later, and the remnant
of that scattered army, in rags, wan and ghastly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
staggered, like a band of spectres, over that same
river. No human might had struck them down; but
the ice of winter and the deep snows of the north,
which the fur-clad Russian glories in, had been the
signal of death to the light-hearted child of vine-clad
France. He who had left France at the head of
such glorious armies had returned to his capital
alone with his own brave heart and iron courage, to
find there that the arms and gold of the allies had
done their work.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BONAPARTE&#8217;S ADDRESS BEFORE WATERLOO.</div>

<p>From Spain, the French had retreated step by
step. Ferdinand, soiled, even in his youth, with
flagrant crimes, had returned amid rejoicings and
banquets to his capital, to sink still deeper in shame
and contempt the Bourbon name, and to reward with
dungeons and tears and blood the brave hearts that
had struggled so long and nobly for his kingdom.
Joseph had fled before him on foot, scarcely escaping
with his life from that kingdom, which might, indeed,
have taken a glorious place among the nations, had
he had the courage or ability to carry out, in the
spirit that dictated them, the great and far-seeing
plans of his brother. On every side the nations
turned their arms against the falling emperor, until,
at length, he who had disposed in his palace of the
thrones of Europe had only left one small island,
which must have seemed to him but a child&#8217;s bauble,
in view of the past. He <i>would</i> not rest here, and
the events of the hundred days had roused again the
world to arms. The prestige of his name had won<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
back the allegiance of the French, and thousands
had, as in days of yore, collected around his standard.
The battle which should decide the fate of
Europe drew on. France stood alone, on the one
side, with her veteran troops, and her memories of
glorious victories, and, more than all, her emperor;
and on the other were the united forces of England
and the continent. Napoleon was confident of victory.
On the 14th of June, in his own resistless
eloquence, he thus addressed his army, the last he was
ever destined to command:&mdash;&#8220;Soldiers, this day is
the anniversary of Marengo and Friedland, which
twice decided the destiny of Europe. Then, as after
the battle of Austerlitz, as after the battle of Wagram,
we were too generous. We believed in the
oaths and protestations of princes, whom we left on
their thrones. Now, however, leagued together, they
aim at the independence and the most sacred rights
of France. They have committed the most unjust
aggressions. Let us, then, march and meet them.
Are not we and they still the same men? Soldiers,
at Jena, against these same Prussians, now so arrogant,
you were one to three; and at Montmirail, one
to six. Let those among you who have been captives
to the English describe the nature of their
prison-ships, and the horrible sufferings they endured.
The Saxons, the Belgians, the Hanoverians, the
soldiers of the Confederation of the Rhine, lament
that they are obliged to use their arms in the cause
of princes who are the enemies of justice and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
rights of all nations. They know that this coalition is
insatiable. After having devoured twelve millions of
Poles, twelve millions of Italians, one million of Saxons,
and six millions of Belgians, it now wishes to
devour the states of the second rank in Germany.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madmen! a moment of prosperity has bewildered
them! The oppression and humiliation of the
French people are beyond their reach; if they enter
France, they will find their tomb there! Soldiers,
we have forced marches to make, battles to fight,
and dangers to encounter; but, if we are firm, victory
will be ours. The rights, the honor, the happiness
of the country, will be recovered. To every Frenchman
who has a heart, the moment is now arrived
when he should either conquer or die.&#8221;</p>

<p>The plan which Napoleon had laid down was, by a
rapid advance, to force his way between the armies
of Wellington and Blucher combined,&mdash;to attack one
with the mass of his forces, while he detached troops
to keep the other in check. Let us now turn our
attention to the allies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SKIRMISHES BEFORE THE BATTLE.</div>

<p>They had combined their whole strength at and
near Brussels. The army of Blucher, at this time,
numbered about one hundred thousand men. These
occupied Charleroi, Namur, Givet and Liege. The
headquarters of the Anglo-Belgian army, under
Wellington, were at Brussels. This army numbered
seventy-six thousand men; but thirty-five thousand
of these, however, were English, the flower of the
Peninsular army having been sent to America. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
remainder were Hanoverians, Dutch and Belgians.
The right of the Prussian army communicated with
the left of the English; their commanders having so
arranged their troops, that wherever the attack of the
French should be made, they might support each
other. They could not doubt that Napoleon&#8217;s mark
was Brussels, but as yet it had been impossible for
them to learn by which of the four great routes he intended
to force his passage. Several prisoners had
been taken, but these either could not or would not
communicate the intelligence our commander was so
desirous to obtain. On the morning of the 15th,
however, the movements of the French unfolded
their designs. Their second corps crossed the Sambre,
and drove in Zeither&#8217;s outposts, who fell back
on Fleurus to concentrate with the Prussian corps.
They were hastily followed by the French army.
The emperor&#8217;s purpose was then to crush Blucher,
before he could concentrate his own forces, much less
be assisted by the troops under Wellington. Immediately
Zeither, who had the command at Charleroi,
sent out despatches to all the commanders of
Blucher&#8217;s army, summoning them to his aid. Then
gallantly marshalling the men who were under his
command, they held their ground bravely, though
with great loss, until, finding it impossible longer to
withstand, they fell back in good order, on a position
between Ligny and Armand, where Blucher now
awaited Napoleon&#8217;s attack, at the head of his whole
army. Though the emperor&#8217;s plan of beating the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Prussian army in detail had failed, he might still
prevent the conjunction of his forces with Wellington&#8217;s.
He continued his march, therefore, on the
main road to Brussels from Charleroi. At Frasnes,
some Nassau troops had been stationed. These
were, however, obliged to retire before the French,
who followed them as far as Quatre Bras, or four
arms,&mdash;a farm, so called because the roads from Charleroi
to Brussels, and from Namur to Nivelles, here
cross each other. Here the French halted for the
night.</p>

<p>Lord Wellington, as I have said, held his headquarters
at Brussels. Not a rumor of Napoleon&#8217;s
onward movement had, as yet, reached him. That
gay city presented many attractions to our gallant
officers, and festivals and parties had followed each
other in quick succession. On that very night the
Duchess of Richmond gave a splendid ball, and it
was as gayly attended by the British officers as if the
French had been on the Seine, instead of the Sumbre.
Wellington himself was there. Sir Thomas
Picton, too, our own brave commander in the Peninsular
campaign, who had but that day arrived from
England, also met his brother officers in this festal
scene. The festivities were at their height, when
an officer in splashed and spattered uniform presented
himself at the door, and asking for the duke,
communicated to him the startling intelligence. For
some moments the iron duke remained in deep reflection,
his countenance showing a resolution already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
taken. Then, in a low and steady voice, he gave a
few directions to a staff-officer, and again mingled
in the festivities of the hour. But, before the ball
was ended, the strains of courtly music were drowned
in the louder notes of preparation. The drum had
beat to arms, and the bugle summoned the assembly,
while the Highland bagpipe added its wild and
martial call to the field. All were soon prepared
and under arms, and the fifth division filed from the
park with the Brunswick corps, and directed their
course to the forest of Soignes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BRUSSELS ON THE EVE OF THE BATTLE.</div>

<p>Three o&#8217;clock pealed from the steeple-bells. All
was now quiet; the brigades, with their artillery and
equipage, were gone, the crash of music was heard
no longer, the bustle of preparation had ceased,
and an ominous and heart-sinking silence succeeded
the noise and hurry ever attendant on a departure
for the field of battle.</p>

<p>These incidents have been so beautifully described
by Byron, that we cannot resist the temptation to
quote the passage:</p>

</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote">THE NIGHT BEFORE THE BATTLE.</div>

<p>By two o&#8217;clock the Duke of Wellington had left
Brussels, and before light he reached Bry, at which
place Blucher was stopping, and there the plan of
the day was agreed upon. Napoleon resolved, with
his own troops, to attack the Prussian army,
because that had concentrated all its strength, while
forty-five thousand men, under Ney, were to give
battle to the English. At early dawn, on the 16th,
hostilities were renewed. The morning, however,
was occupied in slight skirmishes, in which the
soldiers in both armies showed their bravery. The
main contest between the English and the French
commenced about three in the afternoon. The
French were drawn up among growing corn, so high
as nearly to conceal them from sight. The seventy-ninth
and forty-second regiments were thus taken by
surprise, and nearly destroyed. Out of eight hundred
men, but ninety-six privates and four officers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
escaped. At night the English general had possession
of Quatre Bras. The number of killed and
wounded on the side of the allies was five thousand.
Blucher fought as stern a battle, but with less success.
He had eighty thousand men, while Napoleon
was opposed to him with ninety thousand. The
French and Prussians felt for each other a mortal
hatred, and little quarter was either asked or given.
When the night of the 16th closed around them,
thirty-five thousand men were left on the field of
battle,&mdash;twenty thousand of the Prussians, and fifteen
thousand French. Blucher had been forced to retire
in the direction of Wavre, and so skilfully were his
movements made that it was noon on the 17th before
Napoleon discovered his retreat. As soon as Wellington
learned that Blucher had retreated, he gave
orders to fall back from Quatre Bras to the field of
Waterloo. A heavy rain had fallen all day, and
made the roads almost impassable with mud. The
English soldiers were wearied with their day&#8217;s labor,
and discouraged by the command to retreat; but
their spirits revived when, on reaching their bivouac
for the night, they were informed that the battle
should be given on the next day. We found little
comfort, however, in our night&#8217;s position; for, as the
darkness closed in, the rain fell in torrents, and was
accompanied by heavy thunder.</p>

<p>The soldiers themselves, although no temptation
would have been strong enough to have induced them
to turn away from the morrow&#8217;s battle, still could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
but feel the solemnity of the hour. Thousands of
those who had bivouacked with them the preceding
night, in health and spirits, were now cold and lifeless
on the field of battle. The morrow&#8217;s action could
not be less severe, and in such an hour it was not in
human nature to be entirely unmindful of home and
friends, whom it was more than probable we should
never see again. For my own part, my thoughts
reverted to my dear parents, and I could not but
remember that, had I not disregarded their wishes, I
should now have been in safety with them. My
disobedience appeared to me in a very different light
from what it had formerly done; but I resolved to
conceal my feelings from every one. I was just
endeavoring to compose myself to sleep, when my
comrade spoke to me, saying that it was deeply impressed
on his mind that he should not survive the
morrow; and that he wished to make an arrangement
with me, that if he should die and I should survive, I
should inform his friends of the circumstances of his
death, and that he would do the same for me, in case
he should be the survivor. We then exchanged the
last letters we had received from home, so that each
should have the address of the other&#8217;s parents. I
endeavored to conceal my own feelings, and cheer
his, by reminding him that it was far better to die
on the field of glory than from fear; but he turned
away from me, and, with a burst of tears, that spoke
the deep feelings of his heart, he said, &#8220;<i>My mother!</i>&#8221;
The familiar sound of this precious name, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
sight of his sorrow, completely overcame my attempts
at concealment, and we wept together. Perhaps I
may as well mention here, that we had not been in
the action twenty-five minutes when he was shot
down by my side. After my return to England, I
visited his parents, and informed them of the circumstances
of his death; and I can assure my readers
that it was a painful task. We were not alone in
our sad feelings. The fierce contest of the elements,
the discomforts of our position, and the deep gloom
which covered every object, all served to deepen in
every heart those feelings which, I venture to say,
even the bravest will experience in the stillness and
silence of a night preceding a battle.</p>

<p>With the early dawn of morning all the troops
were in motion. Wellington was to commence the
action, while Blucher, with all his army, with the
exception of a single corps left to contend with Marshal
Grouchy, marched to support him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ORDER OF BATTLE.</div>

<p>Our troops were drawn up before the village of
Mont St. Jean, about a mile and a half from the
small town of Waterloo, on a rising ground, which
descended, by a gentle declivity, to a plain a mile in
breadth, beyond which rose the opposite heights of
La Belle Alliance. The first line was composed of
those troops on whose discipline and spirit the duke
could most rely. These were the British, three corps
of Hanoverians and Belgians, and the men of Brunswick
and Nassau. The second line consisted of
those whose courage and bravery were more doubtful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
and those regiments that had suffered most
severely the preceding day. Behind both of these
lay the horse. Four roads crossed each other in this
position, affording great facilities for the movements
of the armies. It included, also, the chateau and
houses of Hougomont, and the farm-house and enclosures
of La Haye Sainte, which were very strongly
occupied, and formed important outworks of defence.
The whole front of the British army extended, in all,
about a mile.</p>

<p>The army of the French, meanwhile, had been
marching all night, and many of them did not reach
the heights of La Belle Alliance until late on the
morning of the 18th. Napoleon had feared that the
English would continue their retreat to Brussels.
It was, therefore, with much pleasure that he saw
them drawn up on the opposite heights. &#8220;At last,
then,&#8221; said he, &#8220;at last I have these English in my
grasp.&#8221; Eighty thousand French soldiers were seen
moving, in close massive columns, on the crest of the
height, as they took up their several positions for the
day. When all was arranged, Bonaparte rode along
the lines, reviewing his troops; and when he had finished,
and turned to ride away, a loud shout of
&#8220;Vive l&#8217;Empereur&#8221; rolled after him, which shook
the field on which they stood. He then ascended an
observatory, a little in the rear, where he could overlook
both lines, and from this point directed the
battle. It was an eventful hour in the history of
this great man; and he felt, as did also his troops,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
how much depended on the issue of the day. Victory
alone would give the courage necessary to send
out reinforcements from a country where scarcely
any were left but old men and youth. Defeat would
be decisive of the emperor&#8217;s fate. These thoughts
nerved the hearts of the French, and they fought
with unexampled impetuosity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ATTACK AT HOUGOMONT.</div>

<p>About ten o&#8217;clock the action was commenced, by
an attack upon the gardens and wood of Hougomont.
They were particularly anxious to gain this post, as
it commanded a large part of the British position.
It was furiously and incessantly assailed by the
French, and as gallantly defended by the English,
under General Byng. The French pushed up to the
very walls of the chateau, and thrust their bayonets
through the door; but the Coldstream Guards held
the court-yard with invincible obstinacy, and the
enemy were at length compelled to retire, leaving
fourteen hundred men in a little orchard, beside the
walls, where it does not seem so many could be laid.
Every tree in the wood was pierced with balls, their
branches broken and destroyed, and the chateau
itself set on fire by the shells. Travellers inform us
that the strokes which proved so fatal to human life
have not affected the trees; for, though the holes
still remain, their verdure is as beautiful as ever.
Beneath those trees, and in the forsaken garden,
flowers continue to bloom. The rose-trees and the
vines, crushed and torn in the struggle, have flowered
in new beauty, and offer a strong contrast to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
piles of bones, broken swords, and shattered helmets,
that lay scattered among them.</p>

<p>When Napoleon saw that he had failed in taking
Hougomont, he strengthened his attack upon the
main lines. Most of the British had been drawn up
in squares, not quite solid, but several files deep, and
arranged like the squares on a chess-board; so that,
if any of the enemy&#8217;s cavalry should push between
the divisions, they could be attacked in the rear, as
well as in front. When, therefore, the French artillery
opened upon them, and whole ranks were
mowed down, the chasms were instantly filled, and
not a foot of ground lost. But such was the impetuosity
of the French onset, that the light troops, drawn
up in front of these squares, were driven in, and the
cavalry, which should have supported them, fled on
every side. The Brunswick infantry now opened
their fire upon the French cavalry, with a coolness
and intrepidity that made dreadful gaps in their
squadrons, and strewed the ground with men and
horses that were advancing to the charge. But the
courage of the French did not desert them. Their
artillery played, at the distance of one hundred and
fifty yards, on the British squares, with dreadful
execution. Their object was to push back the right
wing of the British, and establish themselves on the
Nivelles road. But the courage of their opponents
rendered these efforts unavailing; and the struggle
here at length subsided, to rage with greater fury in
other parts of the field. A strong body of French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
infantry advanced, without firing a shot, to the position
occupied by Sir Thomas Picton and Kempt.
They had gained the heights, when Sir Thomas,
forming his division into a solid square, advanced to
the charge with such effect, that, after firing one
volley, the French retreated. That volley, however,
proved fatal to our brave commander. A musket
ball struck him in the temple, and he expired without
a struggle. After his fall, it was ascertained
that he had been wounded on the 16th, but had carefully
concealed it from every one but his servant.
His wound, for want of surgical assistance, had
assumed a very serious aspect.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PROGRESS OF THE BATTLE.</div>

<p>Again the French pressed on, and, attacking the
Highland division, drove them back in great disorder.
But the brigade of heavy cavalry now came
to their assistance, and again the assailants fell back.
A column, two thousand strong, bore down upon
the 92d regiment, which immediately formed itself
into a line, and, charging on the foe, broke their
centre. The French were now reinforced by their
cavalry, and the British by the brigade of heavy
dragoons. A contest then ensued which has hardly
a parallel in modern warfare. The determined valor
of the British, however, conquered, and the French
retired behind their infantry. It was at this time
that Sir William Ponsonby was killed. He led his
brigade against the Polish lancers, and took two
hundred prisoners; but, riding on in advance of his
troops, he entered a newly-ploughed field, when his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
horse stuck in the mire, and he found it impossible
to proceed. At this instant, a body of lancers rode
up. Sir William saw that his fate was inevitable.
He took out his watch and a picture, and desired
some one near to send them to his wife. A moment
after, he fell, pierced with seven lance wounds.</p>

<p>At the farm of La Haye Sainte, the French succeeded
in cutting off the communication of the German
troops stationed there, and put them all to the
bayonet. Here they maintained their position, until
the final attack in the evening. The combat now
raged with unabated fury. Every inch of ground
was disputed on both sides, and neither gave way
until every means of resistance was exhausted. The
field of battle was heaped with the dead; and yet the
attack grew more impetuous, and the resistance more
obstinate. The continued reverberations of more
than six hundred pieces of artillery, the fire of the
light troops, the frequent explosions of caissons blown
up by shells, the hissing of balls, the clash of arms,
the roar of the charges, and the shouts of the soldiery,
produced a commingling of sounds whose
effect it would be impossible to describe. Still, the
contest raged on. After the advantage gained at
La Haye Sainte, Napoleon threw the masses of both
infantry and cavalry upon the British centre, which
was now exposed. The first battalions gave way
under their impetuous attack, and the French cavalry
rushed on to carry the guns on the plains. An
English ambuscade ran to receive them. The slaughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
was horrible. Neither party yielded a step.
Three times the French were on the point of forcing
their position, and three times they were driven back.
They cut to pieces the battalions of the English, who
were slow or unskilful in their movements, but could
make no impression on the squares. In vain were
their repeated attacks. They were repulsed, with the
most sanguinary fury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_b_236.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">TERRIBLE CONTEST BETWEEN THE ENGLISH AND FRENCH ARMIES.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>Napoleon now advanced the whole centre of his
infantry, to assist the cavalry. They pressed on with
an enthusiasm that overpowered all resistance, and,
for the moment, carried all before them. It was at
this critical period that our noble commander showed
himself worthy of a nation&#8217;s honor. Everywhere in the
thickest of the fight, he was seen cheering by his presence
those who were almost ready to fail. He seemed
to bear a charmed life. Balls flew thick and fast around
him, and his staff-officers fell on every side; yet he
moved on unharmed. His unwearied exertions were
at length successful in arresting the progress of the
French, and in wresting from them the advantages
they had gained. Again the attack on the chateau
of Hougomont was renewed. The cuirassiers poured
the strength of their charge upon the 30th regiment,
who received them in a square, and immediately
deployed into a line, that the effect of their fire
might be more fatal, while the instant re-formation of
the square protected them, in a degree, from the next
charge of the enemy. Leaving, at length, the 30th
regiment, they rushed on to the 69th, and succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
in reaching them before their square was formed,
which enabled them to commit dreadful slaughter.
Before the British cavalry could rush to their relief,
only a few brave soldiers remained to effect their
escape. Then, retiring to their former position, the
fire from three hundred pieces of artillery was poured
upon the whole line of the allies. The effect of this
fire was very destructive. One general officer reported
to Wellington that his brigade was reduced to
one-third of its original numbers, and that a temporary
cessation was necessary to the very existence
of his troops. &#8220;What you propose,&#8221; was the answer
of the duke, &#8220;is impossible. You, I, and
every Englishman on the field, must die in the spot
we now occupy.&#8221; &#8220;It is enough,&#8221; replied the general;
&#8220;I, and every man under my command, are
determined to share your fate.&#8221;</p>

<p>Numerous were the instances on each side, among
both officers and men, of self-sacrifice to save their
fellow-soldiers. But, notwithstanding the gallant
defence of the British, their situation now became,
critical in the extreme. The first line of their troops
had suffered severely, and those brought up to assist
them could not always be relied on. One Belgian
regiment, which the duke himself was leading to the
contest, fled from the first fire, and left the duke to
seek for more devoted followers. Another, being
ordered to support a charge, was so long in doing it,
that the duke sent word to their commander, either
to advance immediately, or to draw off his men altogether.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
He thanked his Grace for the permission,
and started for Brussels, alarming the town with a
report that the French were at his heels.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ARRIVAL OF THE PRUSSIAN FORCE.</div>

<p>The Duke of Wellington felt and expressed the
greatest anxiety. He exerted himself to the utmost
to cheer his men; but, as he saw how fatal were the
French charges, he said to one of the officers near
him, &#8220;O that night, or Blucher, would come!&#8221;
Napoleon saw, at last, as he imagined, that the contest
was nearly won. Already were couriers sent
off to Paris to announce to its anxious multitudes
that victory had crowned his efforts. Already had
the shouts of victory! victory! passed from rank
to rank among the French, as they saw the lines of
the English tremble and fall back. But now a sound
was heard which stilled, for a moment, even the fierce
tumult of the battle. It was the voice of the trumpet,
announcing the arrival of fresh troops; and the
most intense anxiety pervaded every heart, to learn
to what army they belonged. Both parties felt that
the answer must decide the fate of the day. Marshal
Grouchy had been stationed, with thirty thousand
men, to control the movements of the Prussian
army; and, in case of a severe engagement, he was
to advance with his men to assist Napoleon. At daybreak,
an aid-de-camp was sent, commanding him
to be in readiness at a moment&#8217;s warning. Soon
after, another followed, requesting him to march immediately
to the scene of action. At ten o&#8217;clock, he
had not moved from his encampment. Still, Napoleon&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
confidence in him was unshaken. &#8220;He has
committed a horrible fault,&#8221; said he; &#8220;but he will
repair it.&#8221; Every hour he had expected his arrival;
and now, when the first files of the new army
emerged from the wood, he felt almost certain that
his hopes were realized. But the Prussian standard
was unfurled, and the English, with loud cheers and
renewed courage, returned to the charge. Even
then, Napoleon persisted believing that the Prussian
army was only retreating before the marshal,
and that he would soon appear on the field. He was
mistaken.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHARGE OF THE OLD GUARD.</div>

<p>Grouchy, if report may be believed, corrupted by
British gold, remained in inglorious safety in his
camp. He himself always maintained that he believed
the small detachment of the Prussian army
which remained near him was the whole of their
force; and that, though the very ground under him
was shaken by the reverberation of the continued
discharges of artillery, he was acting up to his
orders in remaining to check the Prussians. Be this
as it may, his conduct decided the fate of the day.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>
&#8220;The destiny of Europe hung on the feeble intellect
of a single man; and his sluggish arm, in its tardy
movements, swept crowns and thrones before it,
overturned one of the mightiest spirits the world
ever nurtured, and set back the day of Europe&#8217;s final
emancipation half a century. In a moment, Napoleon
saw that he could not sustain the attack of so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
many fresh troops, if once allowed to form a junction
with the allied forces; and so he determined to
stake his fate on one bold cast, and endeavor to
pierce the allied centre, with a grand charge of the
Old Guard, and thus, throwing himself between the
two armies, fight them separately. For this purpose,
the Imperial Guard was called up, which had remained
inactive during the whole day, and divided
into two immense columns, which were to meet at
the British centre. That under Reille no sooner
entered the fire than it disappeared like mist. The
other was placed under Ney,&mdash;the bravest of the
brave,&mdash;and the order to advance given. Napoleon
accompanied them part way down the slope, and,
halting for a moment in a hollow, addressed them in
his furious, impetuous manner. He told them that
the battle rested with them, and he relied on their
valor. &#8216;Vive l&#8217;Empereur!&#8217; answered him, with a
shout that was heard all over the field of battle.</p>

<p>&#8220;The whole continental struggle exhibited no
sublimer spectacle than this last effort of Napoleon to
save his sinking empire. Europe had been put upon
the plains of Waterloo to be battled for. The greatest
military energy and skill the world possessed had
been tasked to the utmost during the day. Thrones
were tottering on the ensanguined field, and the
shadows of fugitive kings flitted through the smoke
of battle. Bonaparte&#8217;s star trembled in the zenith,&mdash;now
blazing out in its ancient splendor,&mdash;now
suddenly paling before his anxious eye. At length,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
when the Prussians appeared on the field, he resolved
to stake Europe on one bold throw. He saw
his empire rest on a single charge. The intense
anxiety with which he watched the advance of that
column, and the terrible suspense he suffered when
the smoke of battle wrapped it from his sight, and
the utter despair of his great heart when the curtain
lifted over a fugitive army, and the despairing
shriek rung on every side, &#8216;La garde recule,&mdash;la
garde recule,&#8217; make us for a single moment forget
all the carnage, in sympathy with his distress.</p>




<p>&#8220;Nothing could be more imposing than the movement
of that grand column to the assault. That
guard had never yet recoiled before a human foe, and
the allied forces beheld with awe its firm and terrible
advance to the final charge. For a moment the batteries
stopped playing, and the firing ceased along
the British lines, as, without the beating of a drum
or the blast of a bugle to cheer their steady courage,
they moved in dead silence over the plain. The
next moment the artillery opened, and the head of
that gallant column seemed to sink into the earth.
Rank after rank went down, yet they neither stopped
nor faltered. Dissolving squadrons and whole battalions
disappearing, one after another, in the
destructive fire, affected not their steady courage.
The ranks closed up as before, and each treading
over his fallen comrade, pressed firmly on. The
horse which the gallant Ney rode fell under him; and
he had scarcely mounted another, before it also sunk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
to the earth. Again and again did that unflinching
man feel his steed sink down, until five had been
shot under him. Then, with his uniform riddled
with bullets, and his face singed and blackened with
powder, he marched on foot, with drawn sabre in
hand, at the head of his men. In vain did the artillery
hurl its storm of fire and lead into that living
mass. Up to the very muzzles they pressed, and,
driving the artillery-men from their own pieces,
pushed on through the English lines. But, at that
moment, a file of soldiers, who had lain flat upon the
ground behind a low ridge of earth, suddenly arose
and poured a volley in their very faces. Another
and another followed, till one broad sheet of flame
rolled on their bosoms, and in such a fierce and unexpected
flow that human courage could not withstand
it. They reeled, shook, staggered back, then
turned and fled. Ney was borne back in the refluent
tide, and hurried over the field. But for the
crowd of fugitives that forced him on, he would have
stood alone, and fallen on his footsteps. As it was,
disdaining to give way, though the whole army was
flying, that noble marshal formed his men into two
immense squares, and endeavored to stem the terrific
current; and would have done so, had it not been
for the thirty thousand fresh Prussians that pressed
upon his exhausted ranks. For a long time, those
squares, under the unflinching Ney, stood, and let
the artillery plough through them. But the fate of
Napoleon was writ, and though Ney doubtless did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
what no other man in the army could have done,
the decree could not be reversed. The star that
blazed so brightly over the world went down with
honor and in blood, and the &#8216;bravest of the brave&#8217;
had fought his last battle. It was worthy of his
great name; and the charge of the Old Guard at
Waterloo, with him at their head, will be pointed to
by remotest generations with a shudder.&#8221;</p>

<div class="sidenote">WOUNDS OF THE AUTHOR.</div>

<div class="sidenote">SUFFERING UPON THE FIELD.</div>

<p>Soon after Sir Robert Picton had received his
death wound, while our shattered regiment was
charging on the French column, a bullet pierced my
left arm, the first wound I ever received in all my
engagements,&mdash;the mark of which is now plainly
visible,&mdash;which obliged me to fall back. I bled very
freely; and this weakened me so much, that, finding
it impossible to continue my retreat over the pile of
dead and wounded with which the field was covered,
I fell among them. Here I lay for a few moments,
endeavoring to recover my exhausted strength. But
here my situation was as dangerous as that of those
advancing to the charge. Balls were flying in every
direction around me, sometimes striking in the earth,
soaked with the recent rains, and throwing it in
every direction; but oftener falling on the wounded,
who might yet have had a chance for life, and crushing
them in a yet more terrible death. Many a poor
fellow, who had fallen from wounds, and the weakness
induced by exertion, with the loss of blood, was
trampled to death by the advancing cavalry. It was
this, combined with an earnest desire to see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
progress of the battle, that induced me to endeavor
to change my location. I rose, and with great difficulty
proceeded but a few steps, when a second
ball entered my thigh, which again brought me to
the ground. Scarcely had I fallen the second time,
when a company of Scotch Greys made a charge upon
the French troops, not ten rods from where I lay. I
then gave up all hope of ever leaving that battle-field,
and expected never to rise again. Already, in
imagination, I felt &#8220;the iron heel of the horse&#8221;
trampling out my little remnant of life. The contest
raged fearfully around us. Shots were exchanged
thick and fast, and every moment but heightened the
horrors of the scene. The blood flowed rapidly from
my wounds, and my doom seemed inevitable. An
old tattered handkerchief was all that I could procure
to stop the rapidly exhausting hemorrhage. With my
remaining hand and teeth I succeeded in tearing this
into strips, and stuffed it into my wounds with my
fingers as best I could. This arrested the crimson
tide in some degree. I knew not how severe my
wounds might be; but, even if a chance of life remained
from them, I knew full well that I was exposed
every moment to share the fate of those who
lay around me. Friends and enemies fell on every
side, and mingled their groans and blood in one common
stream. Our lines were driven back, and our
brave men compelled to yield the contest. Rivers
of blood were poured out, and regiments of brave
men were cut down in rapid succession. Nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
could exceed the bravery of the combatants on both
sides. But the French light troops had this advantage
of the English,&mdash;they could load and fire more
rapidly than their enemies. The duke was compelled
to see his plans frustrated, and his lines cut
to pieces and driven back by the emperor&#8217;s troops.
Victory seemed already decided against us. Our
men were fleeing&mdash;the enemy advancing with shouts
of victory. The fate of the day seemed settled, and
to us soldiers it was so. It was not possible to rally
the men to another charge. But, at the moment
when all seemed lost, a bugle, with drum and fife,
was heard advancing with rapid step. All supposed
it to be Grouchy&#8217;s regiment of fresh troops, ready to
follow up the victory, and completely destroy the
remnant of the duke&#8217;s forces. Consternation now
filled every mind, and confusion and disorder reigned.
But the Prussian colors were seen hoisted, and it was
then announced that Blucher, with thirty thousand
men, was at hand. A halt, or rally, and renewed
hopes animated every breast. This was the lucky
moment, and the fate of the day was at once
changed. Report charges Grouchy with being corrupted
and bought by English gold,&mdash;that he sold
himself to the allied forces, and thus gave them the
victory,&mdash;for, had he come at that time, we should
have been completely destroyed. Grouchy never
entered the fight, or rendered Napoleon any assistance
whatever. He was made immensely rich, and
spent his life in the English possessions. He has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
ever been regarded as the man who sold his country
and himself to the allies. His life was neither peaceful
or happy. He died in 1848. That Wellington
never gained the victory at Waterloo by fair and
honorable means, is not and cannot be asserted.
But gold accomplished what neither the iron duke
or his numerous allies could accomplish by military
prowess and skill. Napoleon would have gained the
victory of Waterloo, had not treachery and bribery
done their work. I must own the truth, although it
be the lasting disgrace of my nation. I fought hard
against Napoleon, and for my king. My hands were
both blistered and burned black by holding my gun,
which became so hot, the flesh was nearly burnt off
the palms of both my hands. While I lay upon the
ground covered with blood, unable to move, some one,
more able than the rest, shouted, &#8220;The French are
retreating. Blucher, with thirty thousand fresh
troops has arrived, and is pursuing.&#8221; This glad
sound enabled me to raise my head, and soon, with
great joy, I saw that the French were truly falling
back, and that our troops were following. Again I
felt that I had another chance for life; and this
thought gave me strength to reach my knapsack,
from which I took a silk handkerchief, and with my
teeth and right hand succeeded in tearing it, as I
did the one before, and binding up tightly my
wounds. This stopped the flow of blood while I
remained perfectly still; but the least movement
caused it to gush forth afresh. A little distance from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
me was a small hill, and under its shelter I should
be in comparative safety. O, how I longed to reach
it! Again and again I attempted to rise; but every
attempt was useless, and I was about resigning myself
to my fate, when I observed, only a short distance
from me, a woman with a child in her arms. This
woman belonged to the company of camp-followers,
who were even now engaged in stripping the dead
and wounded, with such eager haste, that they often
advanced too near the contending columns, and paid
with their lives their thirst for gold. In my travels
it has often been my lot to witness the birds of prey
hovering over the still living victim, only waiting
till its power of resistance is lost, to bury their beaks
in the writhing and quivering flesh, to satisfy their
thirst for blood. I could think of nothing else, as I
saw those wretches, reckless of their own lives, in
their anxiety to be first on the ground, and lost to
all feelings of humanity for others, stripping from the
yet warm dead everything of value upon their
persons; not hesitating to punish with death even
the least resistance on the part of the wounded, and
making sport of their groans and sufferings. This
woman came quite near to me. She stooped to take
a gold watch from the pocket of an officer. As she
raised herself, a shell struck the child, as it lay
sleeping in her arms, and severed its little body
completely in two. The shock struck the mother to
the ground; but, soon recovering herself, she sat up,
gazed a moment upon the disfigured remains of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
child, and, apparently unmoved, continued her fiendish
work. Thus does war destroy all the finer feelings
of the heart, and cherish those passions which
quench even the pure flame of a mother&#8217;s love for her
helpless and dependent child. To this woman I appealed
for help; and, with her assistance, succeeded
in reaching the little hill to which I have alluded,
and remained there in safety until the fate of the day
was fully decided.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FLIGHT OF THE FRENCH ARMY.</div>

<p>Between eight and nine o&#8217;clock that night the last
of the French troops had withdrawn from the field,
which had been fatal to so many thousands of human
beings. The clouds and rain, which had rendered
the preceding night so uncomfortable, had disappeared,
and the full moon shone in unclouded splendor.
The English army, or, at least, that remnant of
them left alive, wearied out by the exhausting scenes
of the day, had returned to their bivouac of the
night preceding, while the Prussians, under Blucher,
continued the pursuit of the flying and panic-stricken
French.</p>

<p>History informs us that the horrors of that night
exceeded even the tremendous scenes of the day.
The French were in complete confusion. Carriages
and horsemen marched over the fainting and exhausted
infantry. The officers tried in vain to rally
their men, that they might retreat in order. The
first flash of a Prussian gun would scatter them, in
the wildest confusion. Thousands fell in the confusion
of the retreat, and thousands more were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
crushed to death, or drowned in crossing the rivers.
Napoleon himself but just escaped with his liberty.
His carriage was stopped, his postilion and coachman
killed, and the door of his coach torn open just
in season to witness his escape from the other side.
While Blucher led on the Prussians in this murderous
pursuit, the Duke of Wellington again led his
army upon the field of battle. The wild tumult and
confusion which had pervaded it through the day
was now stilled, but the groans of the wounded and
the shrieks of the dying were heard on every
side. The English re-trod the battle-field, and
searched out their wounded comrades, and hastily
dressed their wounds. They then constructed litters,
and on these carriages were the sick and wounded
borne to the hospitals of Brussels and Antwerp.</p>

<p>I have somewhere read a description, written by
an eye-witness of the scenes of the night and following
day, which I will beg leave of my readers to
transcribe here. He says: &#8220;The mangled and lifeless
bodies were, even then, stripped of every covering&mdash;everything
of the smallest value was already
carried off. The road between Waterloo and Brussels,
which passes for nine miles through the forest
of Soigny, was choked up with scattered baggage,
broken wagons and dead horses. The heavy rains
and the great passage upon it rendered it almost
impassable, so that it was with extreme difficulty
that the carriages containing the wounded could be
brought along. The way was lined with unfortunate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
men, who had crept from the field; and many were
unable to go further, and laid down and died. Holes
dug by the wayside served as their graves, and the
road for weeks afterwards was strewed with the tattered
remains of their clothes and accoutrements.
In every village and hamlet,&mdash;in every part of the
country for thirty miles round,&mdash;the wounded were
found wandering, the Belgian and Dutch stragglers
exerting themselves to the utmost to reach their own
homes. So great was the number of those needing
care, that, notwithstanding the most active exertions,
the last were not removed to Brussels until the
Thursday following.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SCENE AFTER THE BATTLE.</div>



<p>&#8220;The desolation which reigned on the scene of
action cannot be described. The fields of corn were
trampled down, and so completely beaten into the
mire that they had the appearance of stubble. The
ground was completely ploughed up, in many places,
with the charge of the cavalry; and the horses&#8217; hoofs,
deep stamped into the earth, left the traces where
many a dreadful struggle had been. The whole field
was strewed with the melancholy vestiges of devastation:
soldiers&#8217; caps, pierced with many a ball,&mdash;eagles
that had ornamented them,&mdash;badges of the
legion of honor,&mdash;cuirasses&#8217; fragments,&mdash;broken
arms, belts, and scabbards, shreds of tattered cloth,
shoes, cartridge-boxes, gloves, Highland bonnets,
feathers steeped in mud and gore,&mdash;French novels
and German testaments,&mdash;scattered music belonging
to the bands,&mdash;packs of cards, and innumerable papers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
of every description, thrown out of the pockets
of the dead, by those who had pillaged them,&mdash;love-letters,
and letters from mothers to sons, and from
children to parents;&mdash;all, all these, and a thousandfold
more, that cannot be named, were scattered about
in every direction.&#8221;</p>

<p>The total loss of the allies, during the four days,
was sixty-one thousand and five hundred, and of the
French forty-one thousand.</p>

<p>For my own part, I was fortunate enough to reach
Brussels on the following day; but it was not till the
20th that my wounds could be attended to and
dressed. So great was the number requiring surgical
attendance, that, although the utmost diligence
was used by every surgeon attached to the army, yet
many died who might perhaps have been saved, could
immediate attention have been given to their wounds.
On this morning, the surgeon came to me, and, having
examined my arm, declared that it must be
amputated. To this I stoutly refused my consent.
He still insisted upon it, saying that it would surely
mortify, and cause my death; but I said to him that,
if I must die, it should be with my arm attached.
My readers may perhaps wonder at my obstinacy;
but their astonishment may possibly diminish, when
they learn that for <i>every joint</i> amputated the operating
surgeon obtained an enormous price from the
government; and I was confident, in my own mind,
that, in my wound, the fee lay at the foundation of his
judgment. He persisted, but I was firm; and thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
kept my arm, which has since, to my great joy, done
me much good service. Others of my comrades in
arms were not so fortunate. All day long the
business of amputation went on, and at night three
carts, laden with legs and arms, were carried away,
leaving many hundreds of poor fellows on the invalid
list for the remainder of their lives.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RECOVERY FROM WOUNDS.</div>

<p>I remained in the hospital at Brussels until September,
when orders came that all the invalid soldiers
able to be removed should be transported to
England. There were four hundred and ninety
shipped with myself on board the Tiger, and on the
17th day of September we arrived in Chatham.
When our ship came into the harbor, we were welcomed
with military honors, as soldiers deserving well
of their country, and a national salute of sixty-two
guns from Fort Pitt heralded our safe arrival in
port. I was immediately carried to the hospital, for
I was not yet recovered from my wounds, although
able to be about part of the time.</p>

<p>Here I remained until the 3d of December, when
I was pronounced cured by the surgeons of the hospital,
or so far recovered from my wounds as not to
require hospital treatment. My wounds at this time
were so nearly healed that I could dress them myself,
and I began to feel that I was a man again. I
was now ordered to return again to the barracks, and
wait until the board should meet to decide upon the
disabled soldiers. I was ordered to Chelsea, into the
garrison, under the command of Colonel McCabe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
who treated me with great kindness and attention.
Here I remained until the 17th of the following May,
when orders were received for the invalid soldiers
to go before the board for inspection. They did
not meet, however, until the 5th day of June, when
his Grace the Duke of York, commander-in-chief
of the armies of England, convened the board.</p>

<p>Our whole regiment was called, and every man
examined; and, reader, how many do you suppose
there remained? We were one thousand strong,
when we commenced our Peninsular campaign. Only
seven men, with our colonel, who had lost one arm,
were now alive! Nine hundred and ninety-two had
fallen upon the field of mortal strife, and only seven
men, beside myself, could be found, in less than one
year after the bloody battle of Waterloo! Such,
reader, are some of the horrors of war. Nine hundred
and ninety-two men, in the prime of life and
spirits, out of one thousand, sacrificed to gratify the
ambition of kings and nobles!</p>

<p>We passed the board; and what do you think,
reader, was the compensation we received for the
service we had rendered our country during those years
of carnage and blood? One shilling sterling per
day! Less than one dollar and fifty cents per week
was to be my pay for life, if I remained in Great
Britain. Yet even this I was thankful to receive.</p>

<p>I returned, and remained in the garrison at Chelsea,
with Colonel McCabe, until March, 1818, when
I left to visit Ireland. I was then regularly mustered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
out of the British army, and returned again to
my home, to visit the loved scenes of childhood days,
and my ever dear parents, after an absence of eight
years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONCLUSION.</div>

<p>For twelve years&mdash;that is, until 1830&mdash;I remained
near my home, when, in consequence of
certain things in which I was engaged, I was advised
to leave the country with all possible haste. I accordingly
petitioned government to commute my pension,&mdash;that
is, give it up under certain conditions,&mdash;and
settle in the American provinces. The officers
whose duty it was to attend to such business answered
that I could receive four years&#8217; pay in advance,
and two hundred and eighty acres of land in Upper
Canada, upon the relinquishment of my pension.
These terms were at once accepted by me, and
drawing two years&#8217; pay in Dublin, I sailed for Quebec.
Here I received the remainder of my pay. I
immediately proceeded to Montreal, where I took out
the deed of my lands, which I now hold. Not feeling
perfectly safe in the British provinces, I immediately
started for the United States; on entering
which, I felt that I was again a free man, and am
determined to remain such as long as I live. I came
into the immediate vicinity of Worcester, where I
have ever since remained; and, by persevering
labor, have supported thus far a large family of children.
I expect to remain near or in this city, where
I shall be happy to see any of my readers, and relate
to them any of the incidents of my military life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
which it was not possible for me to include in the
preceding narrative.</p>

<p>In thus closing this brief history of my adventures,
I can but look back with regret upon the scenes of
strife and bloodshed in which I have been a participator;
and if my description of the horrors of these
scenes, faint and imperfect though it be, should add
but one particle to that broad tide of influence that
must be exerted ere the nations of this world shall
learn to make war no more, I shall indeed have reason
to rejoice, and to pray, with my readers, that that
blessed time may soon come, when all this bloody
array shall be changed into the peaceful implements
of husbandry, and universal love and good-will shall
everywhere prevail.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
